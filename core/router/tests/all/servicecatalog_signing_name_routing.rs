//! Cross-service routing for the `servicecatalog` SigV4 signing name.
//!
//! AWS Service Catalog and Service Catalog AppRegistry SHARE one signing name
//! (`servicecatalog`) while serving two different endpoints (`servicecatalog` and
//! `servicecatalog-appregistry`) over two different wire protocols (`awsJson1_1`, which
//! posts every operation to `/` and names the target service in `X-Amz-Target`, and
//! `restJson1`, whose operations bind their own URI paths). The router resolves a
//! request's routing key from the SigV4 credential scope first, so both services see the
//! key `servicecatalog`: a service that claims on the signing name alone claims the
//! other's traffic too, and the router answers `500 AmbiguousService` — which is not an
//! AWS error code at all — for BOTH. Each one therefore also requires the request to
//! address its OWN modelled wire surface, through `service_common::claims_request`: the
//! model's bound first path segments for the REST one, and an `X-Amz-Target` naming this
//! service on a path its protocol posts to for the RPC one.
//!
//! This suite pins that: with both services mounted, each one's path space reaches it —
//! whether the operation behind it is implemented (it answers from its own store) or
//! still scaffolded (it answers the scaffold's `NotImplemented`) — and a path neither
//! owns reaches nobody rather than being swallowed by either.
