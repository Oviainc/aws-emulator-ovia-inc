//! Cross-service routing for the `bedrock-agentcore` SigV4 signing name.
//!
//! The AgentCore CONTROL plane (`AmazonBedrockAgentCoreControl`, endpointPrefix
//! `bedrock-agentcore-control`) and the AgentCore DATA plane (`AmazonBedrockAgentCore`,
//! endpointPrefix `bedrock-agentcore`) SHARE one SigV4 signing name,
//! `bedrock-agentcore`, and one `arnNamespace`, while serving two different endpoints.
//! The router resolves a request's routing key from the SigV4 credential scope first, so
//! both services see the key `bedrock-agentcore`: a service that claims on the signing
//! name alone claims the other's traffic too, and the router answers `500
//! AmbiguousService` — an error code no AWS model declares, and a 5xx an SDK retries to
//! exhaustion — for BOTH.
//!
//! The rule these suites pin: a request signed for a signing name several emulated
//! services share is claimed by exactly ONE of them — the one whose own model binds a
//! ROUTE (an HTTP method AND a URI) for the request. Unlike every other shared-signing-
//! name pair, no path segment can decide it here: the two models publish the same first
//! path segment for nine resource families (`/memories/…`, `/runtimes/…`, `/browsers/…`,
//! `/code-interpreters/…`, `/identities/…`, `/capacity-providers/…`, `/harnesses/…`,
//! `/payments/…`, `/browser-profiles/…`) and collide at deeper indexes too, which is
//! what AWS answers by dispatching on the endpoint host plus the `restJson1` route.
//!
//! Rows therefore span the dimensions that rule generalises over: which endpoint owns
//! the route, the method (a path both models publish, bound by each for a different
//! method), the depth at which the two models' URIs diverge, a trailing-slash URI, a
//! route neither binds, and a `Host` that agrees with, disagrees with, or says nothing
//! about the target — because on a signed request the credential scope, not the host,
//! resolves the key.
