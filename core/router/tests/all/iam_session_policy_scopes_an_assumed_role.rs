//! A session policy the mint of a role session passed SCOPES what that credential may do,
//! whether it was passed inline or named by the ARN of a managed policy.
//!
//! RULE: the permissions in force on a temporary credential are the intersection of the
//! identity's own policies and the session policies the mint passed, and a session policy
//! grants nothing of its own — so the service deciding a request signed with that
//! credential refuses an action the identity allows and the session policies do not, at
//! HTTP 403 `AccessDenied`, and refuses one only the session policies allow as if they had
//! allowed nothing. An explicit `Deny` in a session policy refuses whatever any grant says.
//! A managed session policy named by ARN stands for its DEFAULT version as it reads at the
//! instant of the request, so it narrows exactly as an inline document does.
//!
//! Two services have to agree for that to hold — STS mints the session and records the
//! scope it was minted with, IAM holds the managed policies the ARNs name and is the gate
//! that decides a call against them — so this is the suite that can pin it end to end.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: the FORM the scope was passed in (a
//! managed ARN alone, an inline document alone, several managed ARNs together, a managed
//! ARN beside an inline document, no scope at all), the EFFECT its statements state (an
//! `Allow` naming one action, an `Allow` naming a wildcard over a namespace, an explicit
//! `Deny`), and WHICH of three operations of the deciding service the call asks for.
//! Beside the table: a scope cannot grant past the identity's policies, a managed scope is
//! re-read when its default version moves, a managed ARN whose document this emulator does
//! not hold scopes nothing, and `PackedPolicySize` grows with every managed ARN packed in.
