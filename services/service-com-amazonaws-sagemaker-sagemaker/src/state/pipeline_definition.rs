///
/// A pipeline definition is a JSON document in the schema SageMaker Pipelines
/// publishes: a `Version` (the only published one is [`PIPELINE_DEFINITION_VERSION`])
/// and a `Steps` list whose entries each carry a `Name` and a `Type`, optionally
/// depending on other steps of the same definition through `DependsOn`. The service
/// resolves that dependency graph when the pipeline is written — not when it runs — so
/// a definition is refused unless
///
/// * it parses as a JSON object carrying those two keys,
/// * every step declares a name no other step in the definition declares,
/// * every `DependsOn` entry names another step the definition declares — never the
///   waiting step itself, and never a step of a kind nothing can wait on
///   ([`PIPELINE_UNDEPENDABLE_STEP_TYPES`]) — and the resulting graph is acyclic,
/// * every property reference to one of the pipeline's own parameters names a parameter
///   the definition declares, and
/// * it declares at most [`PIPELINE_MAX_STEPS`] steps and
///   [`PIPELINE_MAX_STEP_DEPENDENCIES`] dependency edges between them, the two counts
///   the walk's work is the product of — so validating a definition stays short whatever
///   the megabyte the member's modelled length admits is filled with.
///
/// The returned text is the refusal's message; the caller renders it as the 400
/// `ValidationException` that an unsatisfiable definition is refused with. Each DEFECT
/// CLASS carries its own diagnosis, so a caller matching on the reason can tell one
/// definition defect from another: see [`PIPELINE_DAG_CYCLE`],
