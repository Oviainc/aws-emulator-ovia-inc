//! End-to-end wire tests for `ListPipelineExecutionSteps`.
//!
//! Every case goes over the wire (`POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: SageMaker.<Op>`,
//! `awsJson1_1`) through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses, so
//! what these tests exercise is what a real SDK client gets.
//!
//! The tests assert RULES over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded call:
//!
//! * a listing reports one step per step of the run — the steps the STORED definition
//!   declares, restricted to the ones a selective run selected — carrying the name,
//!   display name and description that definition declares and the RUN's own status and
//!   failure reason, and nothing about work nothing performed (no `StartTime`, `EndTime`,
//!   `Metadata`, `AttemptCount` or `CacheHitResult`);
//! * a run that has reached no step (one still `Executing`) lists none;
//! * the steps come back in the order they are reached, reversed by `SortOrder`, and
//!   `MaxResults`/`NextToken` walk that order exactly once whatever the page size;
//! * a request the store cannot resolve is refused and the listing changes nothing a
//!   later caller sees.
