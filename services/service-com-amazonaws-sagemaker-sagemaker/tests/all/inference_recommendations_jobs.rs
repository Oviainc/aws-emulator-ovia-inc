//! End-to-end wire tests for SageMaker's Inference Recommender job lifecycle:
//! `CreateInferenceRecommendationsJob` -> `DescribeInferenceRecommendationsJob`.
//!
//! Every case goes over the wire (`POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: SageMaker.<Op>`,
//! `awsJson1_1`) through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses, so
//! what these tests exercise is what a real SDK client gets.
//!
//! The tests assert RULES over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded call: the ARN
//! form for every region and name shape; the create/describe round trip for every
//! optional member and both job types; the single clock-owed move out of `PENDING`; the
//! refusal of a name already in use and of an unknown name; and the request-shape rules
//! the Smithy model states in prose (`smithy_query(query="shape",
//! shape="RecommendationJobInputConfig")`), which the schema cannot express and the
//! handler therefore enforces.
