//! `VirtualCluster.schedulerStatus`, and the `schedulerConfiguration` limits its counts
//! are the use of.
//!
//! Every call goes through the production path: the service is mounted in the real
//! `MultiServiceRouter` by the harness this crate's core suite owns
//! ([`crate::virtual_cluster_job_run_loop`]), and driven with restJson1 HTTP requests, so
//! routing, deserialization, constraint validation, the handler and serialization all run
//! exactly as they do for an AWS SDK client.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. `schedulerStatus` is COUNTED out of the job runs the service holds for the cluster:
//!    `currentInQueueJobRuns` is its runs in `PENDING` or `SUBMITTED`,
//!    `currentConcurrentJobRuns` its runs in `RUNNING`. Both members default to `0`, so a
//!    cluster holding no run reports zeros rather than nothing, and a run that has left
//!    both sets (a cancelled one) counts in neither.
//! 2. `schedulerConfiguration.maxConcurrentJobRuns` is the number of runs that may be
//!    `RUNNING` at once: a run the clock has made due waits in the queue while the limit
//!    is taken, and "as running slots free up, queued job runs start automatically" — in
//!    submission order.
//! 3. `schedulerConfiguration.maxInQueueJobRuns` is the number of runs that may wait at
//!    once: "when the queue is full, the service rejects `StartJobRun` requests with a
//!    `ValidationException`", and the submission that was refused is not in the queue.
//! 4. Each limit's published `@range` is honoured at both bounds, and a value one past
//!    either bound is refused.
