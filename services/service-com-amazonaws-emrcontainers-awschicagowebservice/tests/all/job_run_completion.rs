//! Where an admitted job run's driver ENDS: the state the compute it was admitted to
//! accounts for.
//!
//! Every call here goes through the production path: the service is mounted in the real
//! `MultiServiceRouter` by the harness this crate's core suite owns
//! ([`crate::virtual_cluster_job_run_loop`]), and driven with restJson1 HTTP requests, so
//! routing, deserialization, constraint validation, the handler and serialization all run
//! exactly as they do for an AWS SDK client.
//!
//! The rule under test, asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded request:
//! a job run this service admitted to a virtual cluster reaches, when the end of its
//! driver falls due, the terminal state that cluster's compute accounts for —
//!
//! 1. while the cluster the run was admitted to is available (held at the run's own
//!    region and still `RUNNING`), the run's driver reached its end, so the run settles in
//!    the modelled state for a job run that finished, with a `finishedAt` strictly after
//!    its `createdAt` and NO `failureReason`; and
//! 2. once that cluster is no longer available, there is no compute left to finish the
//!    run on, so it settles in the modelled failure state with the `FailureReason` that
//!    names unavailable compute.
//!
//! Rule 1 holds for every submission the service admits — whichever `JobDriver` member it
//! carries, and whether the run was admitted straight away or only once a concurrency slot
//! freed — because none of that is what the end of the driver is decided by.
