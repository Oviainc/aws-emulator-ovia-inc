//! `CreateVirtualCluster`, a SPENT `clientToken`, and the cluster that token already
//! names, end to end.
//!
//! Every call here goes through the production path: the service is mounted in the real
//! `MultiServiceRouter` (the harness [`crate::virtual_cluster_job_run_loop`] owns) and
//! driven with restJson1 HTTP requests, so routing, deserialization, constraint
//! validation, the handler and serialization all run exactly as they do for an AWS SDK
//! client.
//!
//! The rule under test: a `clientToken` names ONE request, so a second call carrying a
//! token already spent in the same scope is a replay — answered with the resource the
//! first call minted — only when it carries the SAME request; one differing in ANY member
//! that reaches the stored resource is refused with the modelled `ValidationException`
//! (HTTP 400), persists nothing, and leaves the first resource exactly as its own request
//! described it.
//!
//! The suite beside this one ([`crate::spent_token_with_a_different_request`]) asserts the
//! refusal over four operations; this one asserts what the refused call must NOT have done
//! to the cluster the token names, at the depth a reader sees it — the whole
//! `DescribeVirtualCluster` answer, before and after — over a TABLE whose rows differ in
//! WHICH member of `CreateVirtualClusterRequest` the second call changed: a top-level
//! string, a member two and three levels down, a reference to another stored resource, a
//! boolean, a number at each end of its published range, a map's value, its entry count,
//! and a member dropped altogether.
