//! `UpdateVirtualCluster`, end to end.
//!
//! Every call goes through the production path: the service is mounted in the real
//! `MultiServiceRouter` by the harness this crate's core suite owns
//! ([`crate::virtual_cluster_job_run_loop`]), and driven with restJson1 HTTP requests
//! (`PATCH /virtualclusters/{id}`), so routing, deserialization, constraint validation,
//! the handler and serialization all run exactly as they do for an AWS SDK client.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. The submitted `schedulerConfiguration` FULLY REPLACES the stored one: "the new
//!    configuration fully replaces the existing one. If you omit a field, the
//!    corresponding limit is removed" — so a request that carries no configuration at all
//!    leaves the cluster with none, and a cluster with no limit configured reports no
//!    `schedulerConfiguration` member ("the service does not return this field when no
//!    scheduler limits are configured").
//! 2. The update is PERSISTED and nothing else about the cluster moves: a later
//!    `DescribeVirtualCluster` answers exactly what the update answered, and the
//!    cluster's identity and creation members are untouched.
//! 3. `clientToken` is an `@idempotencyToken`: "if this token matches a previous request,
//!    the service ignores the request, but does not return an error", so a replayed token
//!    leaves the cluster as the first call left it while a fresh one applies.
//! 4. The new `maxConcurrentJobRuns` is the limit the scheduler then enforces: raising it
//!    (or removing it) frees running slots and "as running slots free up, queued job runs
//!    start automatically"; lowering it does not evict the runs already running.
//! 5. A request naming no stored cluster, and one naming a cluster whose teardown has
//!    started, are refused with the modelled errors; each limit's published `@range` is
//!    honoured at both bounds and refused one past either.
