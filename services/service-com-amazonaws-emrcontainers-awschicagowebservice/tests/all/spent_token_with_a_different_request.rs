//! What a SPENT `@idempotencyToken` means, over every operation of this service whose
//! input carries one, end to end.
//!
//! Every call here goes through the production path: the service is mounted in the real
//! `MultiServiceRouter` (the harness [`crate::virtual_cluster_job_run_loop`] owns) and
//! driven with restJson1 HTTP requests, so routing, deserialization, constraint
//! validation, the handler and serialization all run exactly as they do for an AWS SDK
//! client.
//!
//! The rule under test: a `clientToken` names ONE request. A later call carrying a token
//! already spent in the same scope is a replay — answered with the resource the first
//! call minted — only when it carries the SAME request; one carrying different
//! parameters is refused with the operation's modelled `ValidationException` (HTTP 400),
//! because answering it with the earlier resource would silently drop the work this call
//! asked for. Two spellings of one request (a collection omitted beside the same
//! collection sent empty, a map whose entries are stored in hash order) are the same
//! request and still replay.
//!
//! Asserted over a TABLE, not one recorded request: four operations, with rows differing
//! in WHICH member differs — a top-level string, a member nested two or three levels
//! down, a list's contents and its ORDER, a map entry, a number, a boolean, and a member
//! the first request did not carry at all.
