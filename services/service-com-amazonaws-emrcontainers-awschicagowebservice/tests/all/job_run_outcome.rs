//! What becomes of a job run nobody cancels: the outcome the clock owes it.
//!
//! Every call goes through the production path: the service is mounted in the real
//! `MultiServiceRouter` by the harness this crate's core suite owns
//! ([`crate::virtual_cluster_job_run_loop`]), and driven with restJson1 HTTP requests, so
//! routing, deserialization, constraint validation, the handler and serialization all run
//! exactly as they do for an AWS SDK client.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of submissions rather than one
//! request:
//!
//! 1. A job run the service hands back in a non-terminal state REACHES a terminal one on
//!    the clock, so a client that polls `DescribeJobRun` eventually reads a terminal
//!    `state` of the modelled `JobRunState` enum together with a `finishedAt` no earlier
//!    than the run's `createdAt`, and the state the run is reported in brings its
//!    `stateDetails` with it. The outcome here is the modelled FAILURE state with a
//!    `failureReason` of the modelled `FailureReason` enum: this emulator executes no
//!    Spark workload, so the driver a submission names never runs, and a run reported as
//!    having completed would state an outcome nothing produced.
//! 2. `retryPolicyExecution.currentAttemptCount` is "the current number of attempts made
//!    on the driver of the job", counted out of the run's own lifecycle: none while the
//!    run is still waiting for a running slot, one from the admission that starts it, and
//!    unchanged by reading the run. A run submitted without a `retryPolicyConfiguration`
//!    reports no `retryPolicyExecution` at all.
//! 3. `ListJobRuns`' `states` filter selects a run by the state it has reached, and
//!    reports it exactly as `DescribeJobRun` does.
