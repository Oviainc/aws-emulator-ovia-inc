//! The queue-depth limit a virtual cluster enforces is the one it CURRENTLY carries.
//!
//! Every call goes through the production path: the service is mounted in the real
//! `MultiServiceRouter` by the harness this crate's core suite owns
//! ([`crate::virtual_cluster_job_run_loop`]), and the endpoints are driven through the
//! helpers of [`crate::virtual_cluster_scheduler_status`] and
//! [`crate::virtual_cluster_update`], so there is one definition of each request rather
//! than a second copy here.
//!
//! The rule under test — the one its sibling suites leave to this one, because each of
//! them drives a single queue-depth limit, installed by the create, at its published
//! minimum:
//!
//! `schedulerConfiguration.maxInQueueJobRuns` is "the maximum number of job runs that can
//! be in the `PENDING` or `SUBMITTED` state at any time for the virtual cluster. When the
//! queue is full, the service rejects `StartJobRun` requests with a
//! `ValidationException`" — enforced at the depth the cluster carries WHEN the submission
//! arrives, whichever call installed it and whatever its value inside the published
//! range, and taking work again as soon as the queue has room.
