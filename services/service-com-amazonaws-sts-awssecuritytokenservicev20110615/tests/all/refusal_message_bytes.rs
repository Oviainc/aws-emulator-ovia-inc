//! The BYTES an STS refusal states, over the class of requests that provoke one.
//!
//! Two rules, each asserted over a table rather than one recorded request.
//!
//! **A member whose value the service does not disclose.** A constraint refusal names the
//! member it refused and echoes the value it was handed — that echo is where a caller sees
//! what to fix — except for a member the model marks `@sensitive`, whose clause states no
//! value at all: `Value at '<member path>' failed to satisfy constraint: <requirement>`.
//! It holds whatever the constraint was and whether the member was there: the `null` the
//! framework writes for an absent member is a value segment too, and the member AWS
//! redacts has none. A member the model does NOT mark sensitive keeps its value half,
//! absent (`Value null at …`) or present (`Value '<as sent>' at …`) — which is what makes
//! the rule one about `@sensitive` rather than about absence.
//!
//! **The escaping of the message's text.** XML asks a text node to escape `&` and `<`
//! (and `>` only where it would close a `]]>`); the quote characters are markup only
//! inside an attribute value, so a message's apostrophes reach the wire as themselves.
//! This is read off the RAW response body, because an XML parser hides the difference —
//! the member path inside a validation message is delimited by literal apostrophes, and so
//! is every other apostrophe an STS message carries, including the ones a handler's own
//! sentence puts there.
//!
//! Every call goes over the awsQuery wire through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! emulator serves with.
