//! `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` VERIFIES the token it is presented against the key set the
//! provider the account registered publishes.
//!
//! RULE: a presented web identity token is federated only when the issuer it names is one
//! the account registered a provider for AND the token's signature checks out against the
//! key set that issuer publishes; every other outcome is refused as the class it is, each
//! with the fixed text AWS words for that class — a token nothing signed, a signature that
//! did not check out against the published keys, an issuer the account registered no
//! provider for, and an issuer whose verification key could not be retrieved at all.
//!
//! The issuers whose keys can be read are the ones this emulator SERVES: an Amazon Cognito
//! user pool publishes its key set at `<iss>/.well-known/jwks.json` in this same process, so
//! a token that pool signed is verified here exactly as any third party holding that key set
//! would verify it — and a token of an issuer outside the emulator has no key to be checked
//! against, which is the one condition the key-retrieval refusal is worded for.
//!
//! Every row drives the real path end to end on ONE shared engine: the pool, its app client
//! and its user are created through Amazon Cognito's own operations, the ID token comes from
//! a real sign-in, the OpenID Connect provider is registered through `iam`'s own operation
//! and the role's trust policy is the document `iam:CreateRole` stored. The rows differ along
//! what the rule generalises over: which PART of the token was altered (its signature, its
//! claims, its algorithm), whether anything signed it, whether its issuer is registered, and
//! whether that issuer's keys are readable in this process at all. The recorded case — an
//! unsigned JWT whose claims satisfy the role's `Federated` statement — is one row, and the
//! recorded positive control — a genuine Cognito ID token exchanged for credentials — is
//! another.
//!
//! The classes that are decided from the token's FORM alone (not a JWT, no expiry claim, an
//! expiry that has passed) are the table in `web_identity_federation.rs`; this suite is the
//! classes that need a provider and a key set.
