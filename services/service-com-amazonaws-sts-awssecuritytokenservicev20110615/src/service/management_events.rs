//! This front door's AUDIT leg: every call it serves is a management event of
//! `sts.amazonaws.com`, recorded in the account's event history where CloudTrail's
//! `LookupEvents` reads it.
//!
//! Every control-plane call of an account is a management event — read-only calls
//! included — which makes the recording a property of SERVING a call and not of any one
//! operation, so it is not written per handler. The shared wrapper
//! ([`service_common::audited_operation`]) is handed the deserialized input before the
//! handler runs, the handler's own `Result` after, and the rendered response last; this
//! module is only what THIS service contributes to each record:
//!
//! * its `eventSource` ([`EVENT_SOURCE`]);
//! * the Region and the account the call was served for;
//! * the members whose values its records LEAVE OUT ([`OMITTED_MEMBERS`]);
//! * the SESSION a call made with temporary credentials was made BY, read off the
//!   account's session directory (see [`SecurityTokenAudit::recorded_session`]); and
//! * which operations REPORT state and which CHANGE it — the one fact a record cannot read
//!   off a request, so it is stated per operation in [`audited_table`].
//!
//! Every request this service serves reaches that table, because it is the table
//! [`crate::service::EmulatedService::override_operation`] serves every modelled action
//! from, so no request can be served by a path that records nothing.
//!
//! A call this emulator has not implemented answers 501 and is NOT recorded: the wrapper
//! drops it, because event history is the record of the calls an account's APIs actually
//! served.
