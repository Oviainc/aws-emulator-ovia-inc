//! The CloudWatch Logs FILTER AND PATTERN syntax: what a `filterPattern` MEANS when it is
//! run over a log event message.
//!
//! `super::validate_filter_pattern` answers whether a pattern is well formed, which is all a
//! configuration write needs. This module goes one step further and RUNS a pattern over a
//! message, which is what `TestMetricFilter` ("Tests the filter pattern of a metric filter
//! against a sample of log event messages") reports, and what any operation that selects log
//! events by pattern needs.
//!
//! The syntax has three forms, told apart by the pattern's first character — the same
//! reading `super::FILTER_PATTERN_DELIMITERS` records:
//!
//! * `{ … }` — a JSON pattern: conditions over the fields of an event that IS a JSON
//!   document, each field selected with `$.path`. A path segment may index into an array
//!   member — `$.arr[0]` names one element and `$.arr[*]` names every element, so a
//!   condition on the latter holds when one element satisfies it. An event that is not JSON
//!   matches no JSON pattern.
//! * `[ … ]` — a space-delimited pattern: a comma-separated field list, optionally with
//!   conditions on the fields it names, matched against the event's fields. A field of the
//!   EVENT is a run of non-space characters, except that a `"…"` or `[…]` group is ONE field
//!   and the delimiters are not part of its value. A list of N fields matches an event of
//!   exactly N fields; `...` stands for any number of fields, so a list using it matches an
//!   event of at least as many fields as it names.
//! * anything else — an unstructured pattern: the terms the message has to carry. A term is
//!   a bare word of the syntax's word characters, a `"…"` string (which may carry any
//!   character, including spaces) or a `%…%` regular expression; a term prefixed `-` must
//!   NOT appear, and a term prefixed `?` is one of the alternatives at least one of which
//!   must appear. A bare term carrying any other character is invalid rather than text —
//!   such a term is spelled as a string or an expression. The empty pattern matches every
//!   event.
//!
//! A matching event also yields the values the pattern EXTRACTED from it, keyed the way a
//! metric filter's dimension values select them (`super::is_log_event_field_reference`): a
//! space-delimited field under `$name`, or `$position` when the list left it unnamed, and
//! EVERY leaf of a JSON event under the `$.path` that selects it — the whole document's
//! leaves, not only the paths the condition happens to name. An unstructured pattern
//! extracts nothing — it names no field of the event.
//!
//! WHAT BOUNDS IT: no crates.io crate parses this syntax — it is CloudWatch Logs' own, not
//! a published data format — so the reading lives here, beside the structural check that
//! already reads it, and carries its own explicit bounds rather than relying on the caller:
//!
//! * the pattern is held to [`MAX_PATTERN_CHARS`], which is the modelled `FilterPattern`
//!   ceiling, so every scan here is linear in at most that many characters and the slot list
//!   and token list it builds are bounded by the same;
//! * the only caller-controlled NESTING is a condition's parenthesised groups, held to
//!   [`MAX_CONDITION_DEPTH`], so the recursive-descent parse cannot be driven deeper than
//!   that by a request;
//! * a `%…%` regular expression is compiled under [`MAX_COMPILED_REGEX_BYTES`] and run on
//!   the linear-time `regex` engine;//! * an event that is JSON is parsed by `serde_json` rather than by anything here, and the
//!   walk that extracts its leaves is bounded on every axis a request can grow: its depth
//!   by [`MAX_DOCUMENT_DEPTH`], the nodes it visits by [`MAX_DOCUMENT_NODES`], each key's
//!   length by [`MAX_SELECTOR_BYTES`], and the map it builds by [`MAX_EXTRACTED_VALUES`]
//!   entries and [`MAX_EXTRACTED_BYTES`] of key and value bytes — so the extraction, and
//!   the response it becomes, are capped rather than sized by the event;
//! * a sample event message itself is held, by the caller, to the largest log event
//!   CloudWatch Logs holds (`super::MAX_LOG_EVENT_BYTES`), so the length every scan here is
//!   linear in is capped server-side;
//! * the tokenizer, the field splitter and the event's field reader are iterative — nothing
//!   recurses on the length of caller input, and every path through the tokenizer consumes
//!   at least one character.
