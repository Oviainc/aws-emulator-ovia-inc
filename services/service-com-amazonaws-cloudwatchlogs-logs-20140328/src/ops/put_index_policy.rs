//! The field index policy of ONE log group: `PutIndexPolicy` stores it on the group its
//! `logGroupIdentifier` names (a log-group level policy is named by nothing but that
//! group, so a later put REPLACES it), `DescribeIndexPolicies` reports it back ahead of
//! any account-wide `FIELD_INDEX_POLICY`, and `DeleteIndexPolicy` removes it. The record
//! is [`crate::state::IndexPolicyRecord`], stored on
//! [`crate::state::LogGroupRecord::index_policy`].
//!
//! A log-group-level policy "is identified by nothing but the group it applies to", so a
//! later put REPLACES the stored record rather than adding another, and the response is
//! read back out of that record — the same projection `DescribeIndexPolicies` reports,
//! with `source` `LOG_GROUP` and no `policyName` ("Responses about log group-level field
//! index policies don't have this field, because those policies don't have names").
//!
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.

//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is

//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-cloudwatchlogs-logs-20140328/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-cloudwatchlogs-logs-20140328.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Creates or updates a field index policy for the specified log group. Only log groups in
//! the Standard log class support field index policies. For more information about log
//! classes, see Log classes. You can use field index policies to create field indexes on
//! fields found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes speeds up and lowers
//! the costs for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those field indexes,
//! because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not
//! match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query
//! for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log events.
//! Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs. For
//! more information, see Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce
//! costs. You can configure indexed fields as facets to enable interactive exploration and
//! filtering of your logs in the CloudWatch Logs Insights console. Facets allow you to view
//! value distributions and counts for indexed fields without running queries. When you
//! create a field index, you can optionally set it as a facet to enable this interactive
//! analysis capability. For more information, see Use facets to group and explore logs. To
//! find the fields that are in your log group events, use the GetLogGroupFields operation.
//! For example, suppose you have created a field index for requestId. Then, any CloudWatch
//! Logs Insights query on that log group that includes requestId = value or requestId IN
//! [value, value, ...] will process fewer log events to reduce costs, and have improved
//! performance. CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the
//! Standard log class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the following
//! fields: @logStream @aws.region @aws.account @source.log traceId Default field indexes
//! are in addition to any custom field indexes you define within your policy. Default field
//! indexes are not counted towards your field index quota. Each index policy has the
//! following quotas and restrictions: As many as 20 fields can be included in the policy.
//! Each field name can include as many as 100 characters. Matches of log events to the
//! names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For example, a field index of RequestId
//! won't match a log event containing requestId. Log group-level field index policies
//! created with PutIndexPolicy override account-level field index policies created with
//! PutAccountPolicy that apply to log groups. If you use PutIndexPolicy to create a field
//! index policy for a log group, that log group uses only that policy for log group-level
//! indexing, including any facet configurations. The log group ignores any account-wide
//! field index policy that applies to log groups, but data source-based account policies
//! may still apply.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `logGroupIdentifier` (LogGroupIdentifier, len 1..2048, pattern ^[\w#+=/:,.@-]*$)
//!   **required** — Specify either the log group name or log group ARN to apply this field
//!   index policy to. If you specify an ARN, use the format
//!   arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:log_group_name Don't include an * at the end.
//! * `policyDocument` (PolicyDocument, len 1..51200) **required** — The index policy
//!   document, in JSON format. The following is an example of an index policy document that
//!   creates indexes with different types. "policyDocument": "{"Fields": [ "TransactionId" ],
//!   "FieldsV2": {"RequestId": {"type": "FIELD_INDEX"}, "APIName": {"type": "FACET"},
//!   "StatusCode": {"type": "FACET"}}}" You can use FieldsV2 to specify the type for each
//!   field. Supported types are FIELD_INDEX and FACET. Field names within Fields and FieldsV2
//!   must be mutually exclusive. The policy document must include at least one field index.
//!   For more information about the fields that can be included and other restrictions, see
//!   Field index syntax and quotas.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `indexPolicy` (IndexPolicy) — The index policy that you just created or updated.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `InvalidParameterException` (HTTP 400) — A parameter is specified incorrectly.
//! * `LimitExceededException` (HTTP 400) — You have reached the maximum number of resources
//!   that can be created.
//! * `OperationAbortedException` (HTTP 400) — Multiple concurrent requests to update the same
//!   resource were in conflict.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 400) — The specified resource does not exist.
//! * `ServiceUnavailableException` (HTTP 500) — The service cannot complete the request.
