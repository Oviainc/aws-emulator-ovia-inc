//! End-to-end tests for the S3-Table-Integration source family:
//! `AssociateSourceToS3TableIntegration`, the read it is proved through
//! (`ListSourcesForS3TableIntegration`) and `DisassociateSourceFromS3TableIntegration`.
//!
//! The rule under test: an accepted associate persists ONE association of the data source
//! the request names with the integration its `integrationArn` names, hands back the unique
//! identifier that association is stored under, and `ListSourcesForS3TableIntegration`
//! reports exactly the associations of the integration it is asked about — each with the
//! data source as the associate named it, the status it is in and the instant it was
//! created — in the order they were associated, paged by `maxResults`. Associating a pair
//! that already has query access names the association that has it rather than a second
//! one. A disassociate takes query access away and leaves the data deletion running, so the
//! association is reported `DATA_SOURCE_DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` until the CLOCK — never a
//! call — has finished it, after which it is gone. An `integrationArn` that is not an ARN
//! and an identifier no association is stored under persist nothing and are refused.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so a
//! response that is not computed from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The tables span what the rule generalises over rather than one request: integration ARNs
//! of three services, two partitions and two Regions; data sources named from one character
//! to 256, with and without a `type`, and two data sources differing only in their type;
//! several associations per integration and several integrations per account; `maxResults`
//! at both published bounds of `ListSourcesForS3TableIntegrationMaxResults`' `@range(1..100)`
//! and one past each (source:
//! `smithy_query(query="operation",operation="ListSourcesForS3TableIntegration")`), and
//! both unset; and deletion instants pinned on either side of the span the clock owes. The
//! store cap is exercised at the cap, one past it, and after room is freed again.
