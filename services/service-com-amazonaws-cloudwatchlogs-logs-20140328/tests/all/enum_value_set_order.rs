//! The ORDER this service lists an enum's admissible values in, over the enums the model
//! declares and the members that target them.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so a
//! response that is not computed from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! RULE: a refusal that states an enum's admissible set lists the values in the order AWS
//! publishes for that enum — the order the enum's own documentation and its model
//! declaration state them in — and, for an enum with no order of its own published, in the
//! ascending order of the values. The order belongs to the ENUM, so one enum reads the same
//! way under every member and operation carrying it, and in both sentences this service
//! states a set in: the constraint clause of a modelled-constraint refusal, and the
//! `Valid values are: [...]` catalogue a policy-document attribute is held to.
//!
//! The tables below span what the rule generalises over: which enum, whether an order is
//! published for it, how many values it declares, how those values are spelled
//! (SCREAMING_SNAKE or mixed case), which operation and member carries it, which
//! out-of-set value the request sends, and which of the two refusal sentences states the
//! set.
