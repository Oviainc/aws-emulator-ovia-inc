//! End-to-end tests for `PutDestinationPolicy`: the access policy an account attaches to one
//! of its logical cross-account destinations.
//!
//! The rule under test: a destination holds at most one access policy, so
//! `PutDestinationPolicy` stores the IAM policy document the request carries VERBATIM on the
//! destination it names and REPLACES whatever that destination held, leaving every other
//! member of the destination as it was; `DescribeDestinations` then reports those stored
//! contents as the destination's `accessPolicy`, a destination that has had none attached
//! reporting none at all. The policy is "associated with an existing destination", so a
//! `destinationName` the account does not hold is refused as an invalid parameter and stores
//! nothing; an `accessPolicy` that is not an IAM policy document — a JSON object within the
//! documented size — is refused the same way; and `forceUpdate` is the affirmation required
//! only for the one update the parameter documents, from granting individual accounts to
//! granting an organization ID.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so what is
//! asserted here is what a client reads off the wire, and a response that is not computed
//! from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over rather than one request: policy documents of
//! several forms and sizes (the smallest JSON object, one statement, several statements, a
//! nested condition, non-ASCII contents, pretty-printed whitespace, and a document on the
//! documented maximum size and one past it), destinations of several targets and names at both
//! published `DestinationName` length bounds, puts that attach a first policy and puts that
//! replace one, every shape of value the member refuses, and each combination of grant kind
//! and `forceUpdate`.
