//! The HEALTH CHECK half of configuring a subscription filter, end to end over the wire with
//! the Kinesis emulator mounted beside this service on one engine — so the record is observed
//! where a consumer observes it: as a record the destination's shard serves.
//!
//! RULE: a `PutSubscriptionFilter` that is accepted WRITES to the destination it configures
//! the filter against — one gzip-framed health-check envelope, before any log event of that
//! filter exists, marked as a message of the control plane and owned by CloudWatch Logs
//! itself, naming no log group, no log stream and no subscription filter, and carrying one
//! log event whose message opens with the service's fixed health-check sentence. The check
//! belongs to the put, so it is written once per accepted put, whatever the filter's pattern,
//! distribution or destination kind, and it lands on the destination's shard BEFORE the
//! records any later ingestion delivers.
//!
//! The recorded flow this was derived from puts one filter with an empty pattern on a Kinesis
//! stream named directly, then writes three lines; that is one row of the table below. The
//! rows differ along what the rule generalises over: whether the destination is named
//! directly or through a logical destination, the FORM of the filter pattern (match
//! everything, an unstructured term, a term nothing in the group will carry), the
//! `distribution` the filter is configured with, and whether the put CREATES the filter or
//! updates one already held.
//!
//! The second test is the rest of the same rule: the check precedes the data on the shard's
//! own sequence numbers, and the ids the delivered envelope carries are the `eventId`s
//! `FilterLogEvents` reports for the same stored events.
