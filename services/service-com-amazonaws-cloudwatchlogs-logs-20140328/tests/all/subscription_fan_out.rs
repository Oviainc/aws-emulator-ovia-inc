//! The FAN-OUT half of a subscription filter, end to end over the wire with the Kinesis
//! emulator mounted beside this service on the same engine, so a delivery is observed
//! where a consumer observes it: as records a shard serves.
//!
//! RULE: every log event a `PutLogEvents` batch stores is offered to each subscription
//! filter of its log group; the filter's own `filterPattern` decides which of those events
//! it carries ("you can subscribe to a real-time stream of log events ingested through
//! PutLogEvents and have them delivered to a specific destination"), and the ones it
//! carries are handed to the resource the filter's `destinationArn` resolves to as a
//! gzip-framed JSON envelope ("When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are
//! Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format") naming the owner account, the log
//! group, the log stream, the filter and the events, each event carrying the message
//! exactly as it was ingested. The log group's `kmsKeyId` is a property of the group's own
//! stored data, not of any destination, so it changes nothing about what is delivered; and
//! `distribution` decides only the key the envelope is placed under ("By default, log data
//! is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to random for a more even
//! distribution").
//!
//! The recorded flow this was derived from writes ONE batch to a CMK-encrypted group whose
//! filter matches everything and reads the records off a one-shard Kinesis stream; that is
//! one row of the table below. The rows differ along what the rule generalises over:
//! whether the group names a KMS key at all, the FORM of the filter pattern (match
//! everything, an unstructured term, a JSON condition), which of the batch's events the
//! pattern selects, how many events it selects, and the `distribution` the filter is
//! configured with.
//!
//! The second and third tests are the rest of the same rule: a `destinationArn` that names
//! a LOGICAL destination is resolved to the physical target that destination names, and a
//! batch that owes no delivery — no filter, a filter nothing matches, or a destination that
//! does not exist — is still ingested and still answered.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path (`POST /` with `X-Amz-Target:
//! <Service>.<Operation>` through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`), so what is asserted here
//! is what a client sees.
