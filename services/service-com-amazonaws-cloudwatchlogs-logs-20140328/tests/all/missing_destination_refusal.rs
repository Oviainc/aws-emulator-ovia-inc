//! End-to-end tests for the refusal CloudWatch Logs answers when the `destinationName` a
//! request names is not a destination the account holds, on an operation that models no
//! `ResourceNotFoundException`.
//!
//! The rule under test: `InvalidParameterException` is documented only as "A parameter is
//! specified incorrectly", so that error class carries no sentence of its own — when it is the
//! error an operation reports a missing resource through, the message states WHICH parameter
//! value was rejected. For a destination the fixed text is "Destination with name " … " does
//! not exist", and its one variable part is the `destinationName` the request carried,
//! verbatim. So a caller managing several destinations can attribute the refusal to one
//! request, and the refusal never depends on the `accessPolicy` beside that name, on which
//! other destinations the account holds, or on how the name came to be absent (never created,
//! or created and then deleted).
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so what is
//! asserted here is what a client reads off the wire, and a message that is not built from the
//! request cannot pass.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over rather than one request: names in every
//! character class the model's `DestinationName` (`@length` 1..512, `^[^:*]*$`) admits and at
//! both its published bounds, names that are a prefix of a held one and that differ from a held
//! one only in case, names never created and names whose destination was deleted, and — for
//! each of them — access policy documents of more than one shape.
