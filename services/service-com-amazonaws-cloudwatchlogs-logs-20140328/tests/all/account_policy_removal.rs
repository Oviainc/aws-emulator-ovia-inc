//! End-to-end tests for what `DeleteAccountPolicy` removes, and for what a refused delete
//! leaves behind.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so a
//! response that is not computed from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The rule under test: a delete removes exactly the ONE account-level policy the
//! request's `(policyType, policyName)` pair names — both members identify it, matched
//! whole — leaving every other stored policy reported exactly as it was; a pair the
//! account does not hold is refused with `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 400) and
//! changes nothing.
//!
//! The tables below span what that rule generalises over: the policy type deleted, how
//! many policies of that type the account holds, and the ways a named pair can be absent
//! (never put, already deleted, held under another type, a name that differs only in case,
//! in surrounding whitespace, or in being a prefix or an extension of a held one). The
//! single nonexistent policy an issue happens to cite is one row.
//!
//! The suites next door cover the rest of this loop: `tests/all/account_policies.rs` the
//! put / describe / delete round trip and the per-type quotas,
//! `tests/all/account_policy_release.rs` what a delete gives back to a later put, and
//! `tests/all/account_policy_selection_criteria.rs` the criteria grammar.
