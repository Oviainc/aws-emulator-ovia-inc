//! End-to-end tests for `DeleteDestination`: removing one of the logical cross-account
//! destinations an account holds.
//!
//! The rule under test: a destination is identified by its `destinationName` alone, so
//! `DeleteDestination` removes the ONE destination that name identifies and nothing else —
//! afterwards `DescribeDestinations` reports no destination under that name, every other
//! destination the account holds is reported exactly as it was, and the state only that
//! destination named (the access policy `PutDestinationPolicy` attached to it and the tag set
//! assigned to the resource) is gone with it, so a later `PutDestination` under the same name
//! creates a FRESH destination rather than reviving the old one. A name the account holds no
//! destination under names nothing to delete, which is refused `ResourceNotFoundException`
//! carrying this service's missing-resource sentence for the destination kind. "This
//! operation does not delete the physical resource encapsulated by the destination", and it
//! "eventually disables" rather than deletes the subscription filters that publish to it, so
//! the filters of the log groups they are associated with survive the delete.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so what is
//! asserted here is what a client reads off the wire, and a response that is not computed
//! from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over rather than one request: destination names
//! in every character class the model's `DestinationName` admits and at both its published
//! length bounds, destinations carrying no tags, one tag and several, destinations with and
//! without an access policy, and — for the refusal — names never created, a name deleted
//! twice, a name that is a PREFIX of one the account holds, and one differing from a held
//! name only in case.
