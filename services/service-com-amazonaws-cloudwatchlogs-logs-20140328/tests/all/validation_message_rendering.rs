//! End-to-end tests for how this service words a request the framework refused for
//! failing a constraint the model declares.
//!
//! The rule: a CloudWatch Logs constraint refusal names the INPUT POSITION that failed
//! and the modeled constraint it failed — `N validation error(s) detected: Value at
//! '<member path>' failed to satisfy constraint: <the model's constraint>` — and never
//! interpolates the value submitted there, nor a `null` for a member the request did not
//! carry at all (the recorded `PutStorageTierPolicy` refusal for an absent `storageTier`
//! states `Value at 'storageTier' … Member must not be null`). An enum's value set is
//! listed in ascending order of its values. The CODE such a refusal carries is the one the
//! served operation declares, which `tests/all/refusal_error_codes.rs` is about: the
//! delivery and S3-table-source operations below declare `ValidationException`, while
//! `CreateLogGroup` and `DescribeLogGroups` declare `InvalidParameterException`.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so the
//! message asserted here is the one a client reads off the wire.
//!
//! The table below spans the class the rule generalises over rather than one recorded
//! request: every constraint kind the model puts on this service's inputs (`@required`,
//! `@length` min and max, `@range` min and max, `@pattern`, an enum value set), the forms
//! a rejected value takes (empty, over-long, punctuated, out of range), and operations
//! beyond the ones any single report cites. Each constraint is cited from the model shape
//! it is declared on.
