//! A Logs Insights QL query that stops before a command's operand: what `StartQuery` does
//! with a pipeline whose last stage names a command and nothing for it to act on.
//!
//! RULE: a command of the query language is the command word AND the operand that command
//! acts on, so a query string that runs out of input before that operand does not compile —
//! `StartQuery` refuses it synchronously with 400 `MalformedQueryException`, the parser
//! diagnostic names the END OF INPUT as the symbol it stopped on at the place the string ran
//! out, no `queryId` is minted, and nothing of the refused query is left behind for
//! `DescribeQueries` to report. The diagnostic is stated inside the SDK envelope this
//! service's refusals carry, which reports the status and the code of the refusal and this
//! response's own request id.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: WHICH command is left without its operand
//! (one row per command the language writes with one), whether the command is the whole query
//! or the last stage of a pipeline, whether blank space or a newline follows it, and where in
//! the string the incomplete command sits — which is what the reported position has to track.
//! The commands the language writes with NO operand, and the same commands given theirs, are
//! rows of the same tables, so the rule refuses what it must and nothing more.
//!
//! The counterpart suites: the accepted strings are in [`crate::query_compilation`], the
//! located character range in [`crate::scratch_queries`], and the diagnostic for the other
//! fault classes in [`crate::query_and_stream_refusal_text`].
