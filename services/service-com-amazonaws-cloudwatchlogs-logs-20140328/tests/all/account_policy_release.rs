//! End-to-end tests for what `PutAccountPolicy` judges against the policies the account
//! CURRENTLY holds, and for what a refused put leaves behind.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so a
//! response that is not computed from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! * every judgement a put makes about the policies the account already holds — the per
//!   type quota ("Each account can have ... either one account-level ... policy that
//!   applies to all log groups, or up to N policies that are each scoped ...") and the
//!   rule that "no two of them" may select the same log groups — is computed from the
//!   policies held at the instant of the put, so the delete that removes a policy gives
//!   back both the quota slot it occupied and the log groups its `selectionCriteria`
//!   selected;
//! * a put the operation refuses stores nothing and changes nothing: a policy already
//!   stored under the `(policyType, policyName)` pair being put is reported afterwards
//!   exactly as it was, down to its `lastUpdatedTime`.
//!
//! The tables span what those rules generalise over — the policy type, whether the policy
//! is scoped, which criteria dimension two policies collide on, and which sentence the
//! refused put breaks. A policy an issue happens to cite is one row.
//!
//! The suites next door cover the other half of this loop: `tests/all/account_policies.rs`
//! the put / describe / delete round trip and the quotas while nothing is deleted, and
//! `tests/all/account_policy_selection_criteria.rs` the criteria grammar, the conflict
//! rules and the one thing a metric extraction document may say.
