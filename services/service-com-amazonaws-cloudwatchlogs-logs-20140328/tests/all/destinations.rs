//! End-to-end tests for `PutDestination` and `DescribeDestinations`: the logical
//! cross-account destinations an account holds.
//!
//! The rule under test: `PutDestination` parses the two ARNs it is handed (`targetArn` "The
//! ARN of an Amazon Kinesis stream to which to deliver matching log events" and `roleArn`
//! "The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to call the Amazon Kinesis
//! PutRecord operation on the destination stream"), refusing a value that is not an ARN with
//! `InvalidParameterException`; it then creates — or, under a `destinationName` the account
//! already holds, UPDATES ("Creates or updates a destination") — one destination whose `arn`
//! is derived from the request's Region and its own name, whose `creationTime` is the instant
//! it was created, and which carries NO `accessPolicy` ("By default, PutDestination does not
//! set any access policy with the destination"); `DescribeDestinations` then reports the
//! stored records, "ASCII-sorted by destination name", filtered by `DestinationNamePrefix`
//! and paged by `limit` / `nextToken`.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so what is
//! asserted here is what a client reads off the wire, and a response that is not computed
//! from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over rather than one request: targets of several
//! vendors and of another account, roles of several forms, tag maps of zero, one and several
//! entries, destination names at both published length bounds and in every character class
//! the model's `DestinationName` admits, puts that create and puts that update, every shape
//! of value the two ARN members refuse, and enumerations of several destinations under every
//! page size and prefix, plus the account's destination quota and one put past it.
