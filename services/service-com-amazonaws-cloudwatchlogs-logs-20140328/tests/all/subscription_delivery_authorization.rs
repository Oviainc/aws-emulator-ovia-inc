//! What a subscription filter's DELIVERY ROLE decides when nothing can be learned about it,
//! end to end over the wire with the Kinesis emulator mounted beside this service on one
//! engine — the assembly a client gets when IAM is not mounted at all.
//!
//! RULE: CloudWatch Logs writes to a subscription destination under the IAM role the filter's
//! configuration names, and withholds that write only where the permissions in force on that
//! role are ANSWERED not to allow the destination service's write action. Where no answer can
//! be had — there is no IAM to ask, the value names no role of this account, or the records
//! cannot be read — nothing is withheld: the health check the put makes and the envelopes
//! later batches owe are written exactly as they were before any role was consulted. A
//! delivery role is routinely provisioned out of band, so its absence from a store is evidence
//! about that store and not about the role's permissions.
//!
//! The rows differ along what that half of the rule generalises over: the FORM of the role the
//! filter names (this account's role under the default path, one under a path, another
//! account's role) and where the role comes from at all (the filter's own `roleArn`, or the
//! `roleArn` of the `PutDestination` logical destination a filter names instead, which carries
//! none of its own).
//!
//! The other half — what a role IAM DOES answer about decides — needs IAM mounted beside this
//! service, so it lives in `core/router/tests/all/logs_subscription_delivery_role.rs`.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path and reads the destination where a consumer reads it,
//! through the harness `subscription_fan_out.rs` owns.
