//! End-to-end tests for `CreateLogAnomalyDetector` and the read it is proved through,
//! `GetLogAnomalyDetector`.
//!
//! The rule under test: `CreateLogAnomalyDetector` persists ONE anomaly detector over the
//! single log group ARN the request names, mints an ARN that identifies it and hands that
//! ARN back, and `GetLogAnomalyDetector` reports, under that ARN, exactly the configuration
//! the create stored — each optional member present only when a call named it — in the
//! status the CLOCK has made due. A request that names no log group, more than one, an ARN
//! that is not a log group's, or a log group the account does not hold creates nothing and
//! is refused; so is a read of an ARN no detector is stored under.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so a
//! response that is not computed from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over rather than one request: a detector named
//! and unnamed, EVERY value of the model's `EvaluationFrequency` enum (source:
//! `smithy_query(query="shape",shape="EvaluationFrequency")`), `anomalyVisibilityTime` at
//! both published bounds of its `@range(7..90)` and one past each, each form a
//! `filterPattern` takes (absent, empty, a term and a bracketed one) and an unbalanced one,
//! a KMS key assigned and not, tags and none, and a log-group list of zero, one and two
//! ARNs, in this region's account and in another region's and another account's. The
//! account's detector ceiling has its own case, filled to exactly the bound.
