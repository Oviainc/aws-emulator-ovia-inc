//! End-to-end tests for `DescribeEvents`.
//!
//! The rule under test: every change this service makes to one of its resources
//! records an event under that resource, and `DescribeEvents` reports the
//! recorded log over the time interval the request bounds, filtered by source,
//! NEWEST FIRST and paginated. Nothing here reaches into the service's state
//! struct — every event is written by a real `awsQuery` call through the
//! production router and read back through another one, so a response that is
//! not computed from the persisted log cannot pass.
//!
//! Every table below lists the events a scenario records in the order the CALLS
//! made them — oldest first, which is how the scenario reads — and the
//! comparison puts them into the order the service answers in
//! ([`newest_first`]).
//!
//! The tests are tables: each row is one input along the axis the rule
//! generalises over (which operation made the change, how the window is
//! spelled, which source is filtered on, the page size, the refused value),
//! never a single recorded request. The harness is the `pub(crate)` one the
//! `cache_cluster_lifecycle` suite owns, so this target keeps one copy of it.
