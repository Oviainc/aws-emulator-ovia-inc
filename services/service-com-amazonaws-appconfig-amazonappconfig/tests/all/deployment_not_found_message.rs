//! The `ResourceNotFoundException` a deployment lookup that resolves nothing is refused
//! with.
//!
//! The rule under test, in one sentence: AppConfig's not-found refusal labels each
//! identifier it echoes with the token that resource kind's own message uses — for a
//! deployment, the application and the environment by their title-cased `Application Id`
//! and `Environment Id`, and the deployment number by the lowerCamelCase WIRE spelling of
//! the member it came from, `deploymentNumber` — so a label is never derived by re-casing
//! every one of a template's labels the same way.
//!
//! Every row drives real HTTP requests through the router the emulator's front door uses,
//! so what is asserted is the `Message` an AppConfig client reads on the wire.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over rather than the one recorded lookup: the
//! number asked for (one the environment never issued, one a SIBLING environment did issue,
//! `0`, and the published bounds of the `Integer` member), which environment of the
//! application is addressed, and which operation does the lookup — `GetDeployment` and
//! `StopDeployment` both resolve a deployment number under an environment, so both are
//! asserted to report a miss the same way.
//!
//! The second suite pins the other half of the deployment REPORT's refusal: the resource
//! `GetDeployment` addresses is the deployment, so a path that resolves no deployment is
//! reported as the deployment that could not be found whichever level of it is missing.
