//! What a store FULL of sessions whose queues wait on an operation nobody submitted does
//! with the next submit.
//!
//! A training session "processes operations strictly in sequence number order. If a gap
//! exists, the session blocks until the missing operation arrives", so no instant the clock
//! reaches settles a session whose next slot is empty. This emulator keeps only
//! `state::MAX_SESSIONS` sessions, so what it does with such a session when it is full is
//! what decides whether a caller naming a fresh session can still be served — the one part
//! of the gap's behaviour the suites beside this one do not reach
//! (`sequence_gap_timeout.rs` covers an operation behind a gap waiting rather than failing,
//! and `training_session_runtime.rs` covers the queue draining once the gap is filled).
//!
//! The rule under test: a session waiting on an operation nobody submitted does not hold
//! its slot for ever. With the store full of such sessions, a submit naming a session the
//! store does not hold is SERVED — the OLDEST waiting session is released, so its
//! operations answer the modelled 404 while a session that was not the oldest keeps
//! reporting its own.
//!
//! Every case drives the service through the router's own `dispatch`, so each assertion is
//! about what an SDK client sees: the HTTP status, the error code and the JSON body.
