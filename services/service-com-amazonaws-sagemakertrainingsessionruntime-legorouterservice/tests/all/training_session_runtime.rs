//! The training-session runtime's submit-then-poll loop, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case here goes through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`, so each call is a
//! separate restJson1 request against one shared engine: a value that survives from one
//! call to the next survived because it was PERSISTED, not because a handler echoed its
//! own input back.
//!
//! The rules under test, each stated once and then exercised over a SET of inputs that
//! spans what the rule generalises over (the union members, the published numeric
//! bounds, the sequence-number orderings, the payload sizes):
//!
//! 1. A submit mints and persists an operation id; a poll answers that operation's
//!    status and result from stored state, and the populated `OperationResult` member is
//!    the one whose `OperationConfig` member was submitted.
//! 2. An operation whose execution needs a model, tokenizer or training engine — none of
//!    which runs in this emulator — ends in the modelled `Failed` status with
//!    `errorDetails` that say so, and never in `Completed`.
//! 3. A checkpoint operation (`saveWeights`, `saveState`, `loadState`,
//!    `loadWeightsForSampling`) is executed for real: a save publishes a model package
//!    ARN built from the request's region and an incrementing version, and a load
//!    succeeds only for a checkpoint the session holds.
//! 4. A status transition is owed to the CLOCK: an operation is non-terminal straight
//!    after the submit and terminal once its stored due instant has passed.
//! 5. `clientToken` is idempotent per session: a retry answers the id the first call
//!    minted and creates no second operation.
//! 6. Operations execute strictly in sequence-number order: a taken or already-executed
//!    slot is `ConflictException`, and a gap blocks the session rather than failing.
//! 7. A session or operation this emulator has never seen is `ResourceNotFoundException`,
//!    including a training id presented on the sampling route and the other way round.
//! 8. A request that breaks a modelled constraint or a rule the model states in prose is
//!    `ValidationException`.
//! 9. `SampleTrainingSession` resolves the session's checkpoint from stored state and
//!    answers a body that is not the request's own payload.
