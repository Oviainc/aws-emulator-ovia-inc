//! A gap in a training session's sequence, at either end of the range a submit may name,
//! driven over the wire.
//!
//! `ExecuteTrainingOperation$sequenceNumber` is `SequenceNumber`, `@range(min: 1)` with
//! no ceiling, and it documents "The training session processes operations strictly in
//! sequence number order. If a gap exists, the session blocks until the missing operation
//! arrives or times out" (`smithy_query(query="operation",
//! operation="ExecuteTrainingOperation")`). So a request may name any sequence number
//! from `1` to the largest the shape's `integer` holds; an operation behind a gap WAITS —
//! it is not failed for waiting — the slot at the head executes, and the queue has to
//! stay finite for every sequence number a request can state rather than driving itself
//! at the end of the range.
//!
//! The rows span the published floor, the largest value the shape admits, and the two
//! together in each order, with the gap between them: each submit is answered, each
//! operation's status is read back from stored state, and the operation behind the gap is
//! still non-terminal while the one at the head has settled.
