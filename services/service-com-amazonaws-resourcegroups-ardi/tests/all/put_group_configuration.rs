//! `PutGroupConfiguration`, end to end.

//! Every request goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` the served
//! emulator uses (the harness is the lifecycle suite's `Emulator`), so these exercise
//! the whole restJson1 path: routing, boundary validation, the handler, and
//! serialization.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one row:
//!
//! * a put is ACCEPTED rather than applied: it answers 202 reporting which group took
//!   the configuration and the configuration document now reported for that group, and
//!   the configuration it carries is reported as the group's proposed one, under the
//!   `UPDATING` status and beside the configuration still in effect, until the span the
//!   put started has elapsed — the span is never zero, so a caller reading straight
//!   afterwards still sees the update in flight;
//! * once the span has elapsed the configuration the put carried is the one in effect,
//!   reported under `UPDATE_COMPLETE` with nothing proposed, and every later read
//!   reports the same thing;
//! * a put REPLACES the whole configuration, and a put that carries no configuration
//!   item leaves the group with none at all;
//! * the LAST accepted put decides the outcome: one accepted while an update is still
//!   in flight supersedes it, and a refused one leaves the stored configuration and the
//!   update in flight exactly as they stand;
//! * a group contains either a configuration or a resource query, never both, so each
//!   of the two refuses the other — including while a configuration update is in
//!   flight;
//! * the configuration a put puts in effect is the one every other operation that reads
//!   a group's configuration then reads.
