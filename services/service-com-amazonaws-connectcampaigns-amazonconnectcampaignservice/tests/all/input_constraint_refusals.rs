//! How this service states a request it refuses for breaking an INPUT CONSTRAINT, end to
//! end over HTTP.
//!
//! Two rules, each asserted over a table whose rows differ along what the rule generalises
//! over rather than along the one request that exposed it:
//!
//! * A constraint clause names the member and the requirement it broke, and states a VALUE
//!   only where that value is the collection the caller submitted: a scalar member's own
//!   value is never echoed back, whatever its type, its length or the constraint class it
//!   broke, while a member that was ABSENT is still stated `Value null` — the one thing the
//!   value half reports about a value nobody sent — and a list is stated as the list it is.
//!   The envelope and the requirements themselves stay the ones every AWS service states.
//! * How many campaign ids one batch state read may name is the SERVICE's cap: a batch up
//!   to it is processed, one answer per requested id, and only a batch past it is refused —
//!   with the list the caller submitted stated as the value of the member that broke the
//!   cap.
//!
//! The rows are built from the constrained members of this service's own model
//! (`smithy_query(query="operation", operation="CreateCampaign,ListCampaigns,\
//! GetCampaignStateBatch")` and `smithy_query(query="shape", shape="CampaignName,\
//! MaxResults,NextToken,InstanceId,BandwidthAllocation,ContactFlowId")`), so they span the
//! constraint classes a request can break — a length minimum and maximum, a range minimum
//! and maximum, a pattern, an absent required member — over a scalar at the top level, a
//! scalar nested inside a structure and a union, and a list.
