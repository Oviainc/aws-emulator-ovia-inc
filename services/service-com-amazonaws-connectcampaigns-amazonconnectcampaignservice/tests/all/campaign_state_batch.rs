//! The batch run-state read, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! The rule under test: a batch state read answers every requested campaign id ON ITS
//! OWN — an id the store holds goes to `successfulRequests` carrying the run state the
//! last start/pause/stop left it in, an id it does not hold goes to `failedRequests`
//! carrying the `ResourceNotFound` failure code, and the whole call is refused (HTTP 400
//! `ValidationException`) only when the request breaks `campaignIds`' own bounds — its
//! modelled minimum of one entry, and the service's own cap on how many ids one batch may
//! name. Reporting state changes nothing, so the same batch asked twice, and the single-id
//! read beside it, answer alike.
//!
//! Each rule is asserted over a table whose rows differ along what it generalises over —
//! how many ids are asked for, how many of them resolve, which run state each resolved
//! campaign is in, and what shape an unresolved id takes — rather than along the one
//! request that exposed the defect.
