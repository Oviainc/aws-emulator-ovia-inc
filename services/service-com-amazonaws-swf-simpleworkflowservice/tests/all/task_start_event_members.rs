//! The members a task's scheduling, start and close events carry, end to end over the
//! service's own wire protocol (`awsJson1_0`, `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: SimpleWorkflowService.<Operation>`), through the same
//! `MultiServiceRouter` the emulator mounts in production. The harness is the one
//! `workflow_execution_lifecycle` already builds.
//!
//! Three rules are asserted here.
//!
//! 1. A task's scheduling event reports the bounds the task actually runs under, so a
//!    decision task's `scheduleToStartTimeout` is the task-list override's own timeout
//!    while an override is in force and SWF's unlimited-duration sentinel (`NONE`)
//!    otherwise — never absent.
//! 2. The event that records the service handing a task to a worker carries the opaque,
//!    service-generated token identifying THAT hand-over, and whether the task was
//!    started as a continuation of the previous one's completion rather than in answer to
//!    a poll; both the poll's own `events` and `GetWorkflowExecutionHistory` report the
//!    same stored event.
//! 3. A close event reports what closed the thing it closes: the `cause` of a
//!    `WorkflowExecutionTerminated` event is `OPERATOR_INITIATED` for an operator's own
//!    `TerminateWorkflowExecution` call and `CHILD_POLICY_APPLIED` where the service
//!    terminated the run because its parent's child policy said so.
//!
//! The rows vary what the rules generalise over: whether a task-list override is in
//! force and whether its timeout is a number of seconds or the sentinel, which read the
//! event is observed through, how many times one run hands a task over, and whether the
//! activity task's timeouts came from the decision or from the activity type's
//! registered defaults.
