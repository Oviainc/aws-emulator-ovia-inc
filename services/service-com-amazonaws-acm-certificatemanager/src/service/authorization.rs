//! Whether IAM lets a request to this service perform the action it asks for — the
//! authorization step an operation runs BEFORE it reads or writes anything.
//!
//! AWS decides authorization at the IAM layer, ahead of the service looking at the
//! resource, so a caller whose identity-based policies do not grant the action is told it
//! is not authorized rather than told anything about the resource, and the call performs
//! nothing. Every operation of this service whose model declares `AccessDeniedException`
//! (HTTP 403) takes that decision; an operation whose model declares no 403 is NOT judged
//! here, because answering a caller an error its operation does not model would be a
//! different divergence.
//!
//! Three pieces, each held in exactly one place:
//!
//! 1. **who** — the principal the request's access key id speaks for: the session STS
//!    minted that key for (`sts_store::resolve_caller`, the same place
//!    `sts:GetCallerIdentity` answers from, so the principal a refusal blames is the one
//!    the caller reads back for the credentials it signed with), else the IAM user that
//!    owns the long-term key, else the account's own published credential;
//! 2. **what it may do** — the identity-based policy documents the IAM store holds for
//!    that principal and the permissions boundary that caps them, read through the IAM
//!    service's OWN accessors (`principal_policies`, `permissions_boundary_document`),
//!    where the collection rule itself lives — so a policy `iam:PutRolePolicy` wrote takes
//!    effect on the next request, deleting it lifts it again, and this service reads an
//!    identity's permissions exactly as IAM's own authorizer does;
//! 3. **the decision** — [`::service_common::iam_authorization`], the ONE shared
//!    evaluation of those documents against `(action, resource)`, so this service and
//!    every other one handed the same documents answer alike: an explicit `Deny` wins,
//!    otherwise an `Allow` about the request grants it, and with neither the request falls
//!    to IAM's default deny.
//!
//! Only the store LOOKUPS live here; the decision does not. That is the same split every
//! other gate in this tree makes (Amazon OpenSearch Service, AWS B2B Data Interchange,
//! Billing and Cost Management Data Exports, Amazon EVS, CloudWatch RUM, Amazon Cognito
//! Identity), and the lookups stay in the service crate for the reason those keep theirs
//! there: hoisting them into `service-common` would make every service that depends on
//! that crate link the IAM and STS service crates.
//!
//! ACM publishes no resource-based policy of its own — the model declares no policy
//! operation and no policy member — so the decision here is the identity-based one alone.
//!
//! ## The callers this gate does not bound
//!
//! * **The account's own published credential.** A request whose access key id neither STS
//!   nor IAM holds a record for resolves to the account's own identity, which is not a
//!   principal the IAM store holds policies for — the position AWS account root
//!   credentials are in. Such a request is allowed.
//! * **A principal holding an attachment this emulator cannot read.** An AWS-managed
//!   policy belongs to AWS rather than to this account, so the IAM store holds no document
//!   for it; refusing on a grant this emulator cannot see would deny access AWS permits.
//!   An explicit `Deny` in a document that CAN be read still refuses, and a permissions
//!   boundary the store DOES hold still caps the grant. An attachment naming a
//!   CUSTOMER-managed policy the account does not hold grants nothing, because the account
//!   is the authority on its own policies.
//! * **An engine carrying no STS or IAM store**, where no session and no role can exist.
//!
//! An expired session credential speaks for nobody: it carries no documents and no
//! principal spelling, so every action it asks for is refused. (A session the
//! authenticating layer has already refused never reaches a handler at all.)
