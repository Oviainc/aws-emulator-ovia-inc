//! How this service states a refused request, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! The rule under test: a request refused for a constraint on one of its members
//! — whether the boundary walk found it (a modelled `@required`, `@length`,
//! `@range`, `@pattern` or value set) or a handler did (a rule the model states
//! in prose but cannot express) — is answered as this service's own modelled
//! `ValidationException`, HTTP 400, whose body carries
//!
//! * `reason`, the `ValidationExceptionReason` value naming that member and
//!   whether it was invalid or absent, or the modelled catch-all `OTHER` when no
//!   value names it;
//! * `fields`, one entry per offending member, `name` being the member's dotted
//!   request path — which for a member of a list element carries the element's
//!   1-based position, so a caller with several of them can tell WHICH one was
//!   rejected;
//! * `message`, the sentence that names the member the reason named.
//!
//! Each row below differs from the others in what the rule generalises over: the
//! constraint that was missed, the depth the member sits at (top level, inside a
//! nested structure, inside an element of a list, a scalar element of a list),
//! the position of the offending element, whether the member was invalid or
//! absent, and the operation that was called. The two cases the trace sweep
//! recorded (`DescribeAgreement` with an `agreementId` outside `ResourceId`'s
//! pattern, and `SearchAgreements` with an unrecognised filter name) are two
//! rows among them.
