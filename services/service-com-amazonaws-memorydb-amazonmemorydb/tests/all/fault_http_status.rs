//! What HTTP STATUS a modelled MemoryDB fault answers with, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives the SAME path a client does: an `awsJson1_1` `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: AmazonMemoryDB.<Operation>` through the multi-service router (the
//! shared harness in `cluster_lifecycle`), so what is asserted is the emulator's HTTP
//! behaviour and not a handler called directly.
//!
//! The rule under test, over a SET of inputs rather than one recorded request: on this
//! `awsJson1_1` service the request URI names the ENDPOINT and never a resource, so a
//! fault about the request's CONTENT is a client fault and answers **HTTP 400** with the
//! fault's own `__type` in the body — NO modelled fault answers 404, whatever
//! `@httpError` its shape declares. The table spans that class along what it
//! generalises over:
//!
//! * the kind of resource the reference misses (cluster, ACL, user, parameter group,
//!   tag key) and so the `__type` the fault carries;
//! * the operation kind that resolves it (create, read, update, delete, tag);
//! * the form the reference takes (a name member, a name inside a LIST member, a name
//!   inside an ARN, a tag key on a resource that does resolve);
//! * and the control: a fault whose shape declares a status that is NOT 404 keeps that
//!   status, so the mapping moves one status and flattens nothing else.
