//! How this service WORDS a failure, driven over the wire (`restJson1`) through the same
//! router the emulator serves from.
//!
//! Two rules, each asserted over a set of inputs rather than one recorded request:
//!
//! 1. A `ValidationException` for a value outside a `@pattern` reports the expression
//!    the value had to satisfy WITHOUT the anchors the model spells it with; every other
//!    constraint class keeps the wording it already had. The rows below span three
//!    operations, four pattern-constrained members with four different expressions, and
//!    the length / range / absent-member classes as controls.
//! 2. A `ResourceNotFoundException` for a graph identifier that names no stored graph
//!    reports the account the lookup resolved in as well as the identifier requested.
//!    The rows span every operation that resolves a `graphIdentifier` and several
//!    well-formed identifiers.
//! 3. That account-scoped wording names the KIND of resource that was looked for, and
//!    then the identifier clause as the OPERATION words it: every lookup but a task
//!    CANCEL spells the resource kind in front of that clause, while `CancelImportTask`
//!    and `CancelExportTask` carry the bare `task id`. The rows span every resource kind,
//!    each of its implemented lookups, and several well-formed identifiers per kind.
