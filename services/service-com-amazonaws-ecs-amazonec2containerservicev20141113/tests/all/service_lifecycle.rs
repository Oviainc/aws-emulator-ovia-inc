//! The ECS SERVICE lifecycle, driven end to end over HTTP: `CreateService`,
//! `DescribeServices` and `UpdateService`.
//!
//! The rule under test: an ECS service is a persisted, cluster-scoped record, and the ECS
//! service scheduler keeps `desiredCount` tasks of the resolved task-definition revision
//! running for it, so every number a response carries (`runningCount`, `pendingCount`,
//! the deployment's `rolloutState`, the cluster's `activeServicesCount`) is COUNTED off
//! the records that exist rather than echoed from the request.
//!
//! Every case goes through the shared wire harness in [`crate::ecs_wire`], the same front
//! door a client uses, so nothing reaches into the state struct and a response that is
//! not computed from persisted state cannot pass.
