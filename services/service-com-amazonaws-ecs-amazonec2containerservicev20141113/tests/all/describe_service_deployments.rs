//! `DescribeServiceDeployments`, driven end to end over the shared wire harness in
//! [`crate::ecs_wire`].
//!
//! The rule under test: a batch read of service deployments reports, for every ARN the
//! request names that names a STORED rollout, that rollout as it is recorded — the
//! instants it was created, last changed and ended at, the service revisions it moves the
//! service between with their task counts counted off the task map, the deployment
//! configuration the release was made under, and the state each failure-detection
//! mechanism that configuration turned on is in — and reports every ARN that names no
//! stored rollout as a `MISSING` failure naming the ARN the caller sent, rather than
//! refusing the whole batch.
//!
//! The docs the rows are read off:
//!
//! * `DescribeServiceDeployments`: "Describes one or more of your service deployments. A
//!   service deployment happens when you release a software update for the service."
//! * `DescribeServiceDeployments$serviceDeploymentArns`: "The ARN of the service
//!   deployment. You can specify a maximum of 20 ARNs."
//! * `DescribeServiceDeployments$failures`: "Any failures associated with the call. ... The
//!   failure includes the service revision ARN and the reason set to MISSING."
//! * `ServiceDeployment$startedAt`/`$finishedAt`/`$stoppedAt`/`$updatedAt`, the last being
//!   "The time that the service deployment was last updated", and `$stoppedAt` carried
//!   when "A user manually stops the deployment" or the service fails with no rollback.
//! * `ServiceDeployment$sourceServiceRevisions`: "The currently deployed workload
//!   configuration"; `$targetServiceRevision`: "The workload configuration being deployed."
//! * `ServiceRevisionSummary$requestedTaskCount`/`$runningTaskCount`/`$pendingTaskCount`:
//!   "The number of requested/running/pending tasks for the service revision."
//! * `ServiceDeploymentRollbackMonitorsStatus` (smithy_query query="shape"
//!   shape="ServiceDeploymentRollbackMonitorsStatus": TRIGGERED, MONITORING,
//!   MONITORING_COMPLETE, DISABLED), whose `DISABLED` reading the
//!   `ServiceDeploymentAlarms$status` doc explains: "Amazon ECS is not using alarms for
//!   service deployment failures when the status is DISABLED."
//! * `ThresholdConfiguration$type`: "For the percentage types (BOUNDED_PERCENT and
//!   UNBOUNDED_PERCENT), Amazon ECS multiplies value by the latest service desired count.
//!   For COUNT, Amazon ECS uses value directly as the threshold. The default is
//!   BOUNDED_PERCENT", with `BOUNDED_PERCENT` "clamping the result to a minimum of 3 and a
//!   maximum of 200" and a default `value` of 50.
//!
//! Every case goes through the same front door a client uses, so nothing reaches into the
//! state struct and a response that is not computed from persisted state cannot pass.
