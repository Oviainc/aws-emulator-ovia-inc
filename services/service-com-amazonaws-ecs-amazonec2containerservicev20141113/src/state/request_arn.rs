//! How this service reads an ARN a REQUEST supplies, and what it refuses one for.
//!
//! An ARN is a WHOLE identifier: it carries the partition, the service, the Region, the
//! ACCOUNT and the resource. Most of this service's reference members accept either form
//! — "The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster" — and reducing an
//! ARN to its trailing name segment ([`super::cluster_name_from_reference`],
//! [`super::task_arn_from_reference`]) throws the rest away. So the REGION and the ACCOUNT
//! segments are compared against the Region the request addressed and the account this
//! emulator serves BEFORE that reduction — Amazon ECS is regional ("Amazon ECS clusters
//! are Region specific"), so an endpoint resolves its own Region's resources and its own
//! account's, and nothing else. Otherwise another Region's or another account's ARN
//! resolves to this endpoint's resource of the same name, and "this ARN is not one of
//! mine" — a programming or credentials error a client must stop on — becomes
//! indistinguishable from "this resource does not exist", which a client retries or treats
//! as already-deleted.
//!
//! The reading is TOTAL: [`RequestArn::parse`] walks the colon-separated fields through an
//! iterator and answers `None` for anything that is not an ARN, so no caller-supplied
//! value reaches an index, a slice or an unwrap. A value that is not an ARN carries no
//! account to disagree with, and neither does an ARN whose account field is empty, so both
//! are left to resolve as the names they are.
