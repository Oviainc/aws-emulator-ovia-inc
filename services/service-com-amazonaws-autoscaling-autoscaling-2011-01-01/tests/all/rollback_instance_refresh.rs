//! Rolling back the instance refresh a group has in progress.
//!
//! The rule under test: a rollback acts on the refresh its group has IN PROGRESS — it
//! answers that refresh's own id, moves it to `RollbackInProgress`, and the clock then
//! replaces the refresh's OWN replacements back, from the group's launch source, until
//! the refresh is reported `RollbackSuccessful` with nothing of its progress left; a
//! group with no refresh in progress has nothing to roll back, and a refresh whose
//! pre-refresh configuration is not pinned — no desired configuration, a launch template
//! version that floats, or an image resolved through a Systems Manager parameter — cannot
//! be reversed at all.
//!
//! The tables below span what that rule generalises over: how many instances the group
//! holds (none, one, several), how much of the refresh had already been done when the
//! rollback arrived, and — for the refusals — which of the situations the error classes
//! name the group and its refresh are in.
