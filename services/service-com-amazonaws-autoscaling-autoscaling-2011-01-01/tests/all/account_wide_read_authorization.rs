//! WHO may drive Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling's account-wide reads — the `Describe` family —
//! driven end to end over the wire this service speaks (`awsQuery`), with the role, its
//! policies and the session held by the IAM and STS services mounted on the SAME engine, so
//! the documents under test are the ones `iam:PutRolePolicy` stores and the principal a
//! refusal blames is the one `sts:AssumeRole` minted.
//!
//! THE RULE UNDER TEST: an Auto Scaling `Describe` action supports no resource-level
//! permissions (the IAM Service Authorization Reference lists every
//! `autoscaling:Describe*` action under "actions with no resource types"), so IAM judges it
//! against EVERY resource: the service serves such a request only when the identity-based
//! policies in force on the principal its credentials name allow
//! `autoscaling:<OperationName>` over every resource, and otherwise refuses it with HTTP
//! 403 `AccessDenied` naming the principal, the action and which of IAM's rules withheld
//! the grant — without reading or changing anything. An action IAM judges against a
//! resource's own ARN is NOT decided here, so a caller holding no policy still reaches the
//! operation's own answer for it.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: the operation (three of the `Describe`
//! family, plus one operation outside it), the documents in force (none at all, an inline
//! allow of one action, an allow of the whole service, an allow in another case, a grant
//! scoped to one group's ARN, an explicit deny of one action and a wildcard deny over the
//! family), and the kind of credential (an assumed-role session, an IAM user's long-term
//! access key, the account's own published credential).
