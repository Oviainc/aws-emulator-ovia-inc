//! End-to-end HTTP tests for `ListImagePackages`.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — the production `MultiServiceRouter`, restJson1
//! serialization, the modelled-constraint walk and the handler — so what is asserted is
//! what a signed AWS SDK request observes.
//!
//! The rule under test: a read of an image build version's packages reports the inventory
//! that build version holds, in one page bounded by `maxResults` and continued by a
//! `nextToken` that belongs to that listing alone; a build version the calling Region
//! holds no inventory for reports an empty list rather than a refusal.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: how many packages an inventory holds
//! (none, one, a few, more than one page can carry), the order they were recorded in
//! against the order they are reported in, the page size the request asks for, which
//! Region asks, and which listing a token was issued for.
//!
//! The inventory is recorded through the store's own write path
//! (`ComAmazonawsImagebuilderImagebuilderState::insert_image`), which is where the image
//! build path files what a build observed: Systems Manager Inventory is taken on the
//! instance a build ran on, so nothing a request carries can derive it. That write path's
//! own bounds — how many build versions the store holds and how many packages one record
//! keeps — are exercised by the last two cases.
