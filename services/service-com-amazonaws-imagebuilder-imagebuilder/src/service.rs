//! The `com-amazonaws-imagebuilder-imagebuilder` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. This service serves the operation the model's own routing key names,
//!   wrapped (see "This service's front door" below).
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. Nothing is reworded there: a refusal this service words
//!   itself is worded at its front door, which is the only layer that can place one.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## This service's front door: a parameter whose value the model does not admit
//!
//! Image Builder refuses such a value as the one class its model documents for it,
//! `InvalidParameterValueException` (HTTP 400), naming the parameter the request carried
//! and the requirement its value had to satisfy. [`parameter_refusal`] owns that sentence;
//! what this file owns is WHERE it is stated, which cannot be [`Service::override_refusal`]:
//! the centralized walk hands that seam the violations ALONE — no operation, no request — and
//! this service quotes the expression an ARN member's value had to match in the form of the
//! layer that READ the value, while this model binds one member name both ways
//! (`imagePipelineArn` is `GetImagePipeline`'s `@httpQuery` parameter and
//! `StartImagePipelineExecution`'s body member). So two refusals that are indistinguishable
//! from the violations alone are worded differently on the wire.
//!
//! [`service_common::front_door::FrontDoor`] is where that distinction lives: every modelled
//! operation is served wrapped in it, and the wrapper reads the HTTP BINDING of each violated
//! member off THAT operation's own input schema, then words the body half and the
//! request-line half through the two wordings attached to the door.
//!
//! ## Naming the request a response answers
//!
//! Every response Image Builder sends names the request it answered: a success through the
//! `requestId` member its output shape models, and a FAILURE through the same member in its
//! error body, which no error shape of this model declares — so no handler can set it, and
//! the framework's `restJson1` error renderers write the `__type` and the `message` alone.
//!
//! The rule is not restated here: `service_common::query_error_envelope` owns it for every
//! emulated service, and this file only chooses the report this service's envelope takes (the
//! body member) and wires it at the two layers every response of this service passes through:
//!
//! * [`RequestIdReportingOperation::error_member`], wrapped around each operation's own front
//!   door, covers everything an operation answers — a success (untouched), a modelled error, a
//!   refusal its door worded, and a constraint refusal raised while it was being served;
//! * [`RequestIdEnvelopeDefinition::error_member`], the definition wrapper `definition` hands
//!   back, covers a response NO operation produced: a routing failure, a transport failure
//!   detected up front, and a pre-dispatch authentication refusal.
