//! The `com-amazonaws-mediatailor-mediatailor` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. Return `Some(op)` to route one yourself.
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## Naming the request a response answers
//!
//! Every error response MediaTailor sends names the request it answered, in the
//! `requestId` member of its JSON error body beside the `__type` and the `message`. No
//! error shape of this model declares that member — it belongs to the response, so no
//! handler can set it, and the framework's `restJson1` error renderers write the `__type`
//! and the `message` alone.
//!
//! The rule is not restated here: `service_common::query_error_envelope` owns it for every
//! emulated service, and this file only chooses the report this service's envelope takes
//! (the body member) and wires it at the two layers every response of this service passes
//! through:
//!
//! * [`RequestIdErrorMemberOperation`], handed back from `override_operation` for a request
//!   the generated routing table can serve, covers everything an operation answers — a
//!   success (untouched), a modelled error, this service's own not-found and
//!   not-implemented envelopes, and a constraint refusal raised while it was being served;
//! * [`RequestIdEnvelopeDefinition::error_member`], the definition wrapper `definition`
//!   hands back, covers a response NO operation produced: a routing failure, a transport
//!   failure detected up front, and a pre-dispatch authentication refusal.
