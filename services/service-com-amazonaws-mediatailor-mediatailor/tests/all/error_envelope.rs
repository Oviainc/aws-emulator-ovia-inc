//! The rule under test: every error response this service returns carries, in
//! its restJson1 body, the refusal's text under the one wire key `message` and
//! a `requestId` naming that response — whichever operation was called,
//! whichever error shape answers it (the modelled `BadRequestException`, the
//! service's own not-found envelope, or the scaffold's not-implemented signal)
//! and whatever status it carries.
//!
//! The table spans the class the rule generalises over: both HTTP methods that
//! refuse with a body, each of the three error shapes and each status they
//! carry (400, 404, 501), a refusal raised before the store is read and one
//! raised by the read itself, a message that is entirely fixed text and one
//! with a variable part taken from the request, and a resource addressed by
//! name as well as one addressed by ARN. The recorded cases — a duplicate
//! channel name, a read of an absent channel, a `PercentEnabled` above the
//! documented maximum and a configure-logs call for an absent configuration —
//! are four rows of it.
