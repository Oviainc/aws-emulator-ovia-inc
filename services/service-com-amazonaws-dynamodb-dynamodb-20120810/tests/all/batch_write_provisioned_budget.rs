//! What the write capacity a table is PROVISIONED for does to a STREAM of
//! `BatchWriteItem` calls.
//!
//! One rule over a table of inputs: every request of a batch is admitted on its own
//! against the write capacity its table has left, so a table provisioned for a write rate
//! cannot absorb a stream of writes past that rate plus the burst credit it holds. What a
//! call does not admit comes back in `UnprocessedItems` in the form it was sent ("you can
//! provide this value directly to a subsequent BatchWriteItem operation") with HTTP 200
//! and stores nothing, and a call that could store nothing at all is refused with
//! `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. The keys that landed and the keys handed back
//! therefore partition the requested keys exactly: no key is both, and none is neither. A
//! table in on-demand mode is provisioned for no capacity to exceed, so it absorbs the
//! same stream whole.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the capacity mode, the write
//! units the table is provisioned for, the bytes of each item (and so the units one write
//! costs), the requests per batch, and the number of batches in the stream — from a single
//! batch a fresh burst covers whole, through streams of ten to 320 batches, to a batch
//! whose every request asks for more than its table's credit could ever hold.
//!
//! The table here is keyed by a partition key alone and every write is aimed at a key of
//! its own, so the ceiling under test is the table's own provisioning rather than the
//! per-partition-key one.
