//! Consumption of the SOURCE a Firehose stream is fed by, where that source is a Kinesis
//! data stream.
//!
//! `PutRecord` / `PutRecordBatch` are how a `DirectPut` stream gets its data — "Provider
//! applications access the Firehose stream directly"
//! (`CreateDeliveryStreamInput$DeliveryStreamType`) — and a stream of any other type is fed
//! by the service its source configuration names instead, which is why the ingestion
//! operations are refused on one (`crate::state::DeliveryStream::takes_a_configured_source`).
//! This module is the other half of that rule for the one source whose data this emulator
//! holds: the Kinesis data stream of a `KinesisStreamAsSource` stream's
//! `KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration`, "the stream and role Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for
//! a Kinesis data stream used as the source for a Firehose stream".
//!
//! What is consumed, and from where:
//!
//! * WHICH stream — the `KinesisStreamARN` of the stored `KinesisStreamSourceDescription`,
//!   resolved against the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams service's own store: the one register
//!   of streams, shards and records in this emulator, so what a producer's `PutRecord` wrote
//!   there is exactly what is read back here.
//! * FROM WHERE — `DeliveryStartTimestamp`, since "Firehose starts retrieving records from
//!   the Kinesis data stream starting with this timestamp"
//!   (`KinesisStreamSourceDescription$DeliveryStartTimestamp`): a record the source held
//!   before the Firehose stream existed is not this stream's data. From then on each shard
//!   is read from the sequence number this stream last buffered from it
//!   ([`crate::state::DeliveryStream::source_positions`]), so every record is buffered
//!   exactly once and the shard's own order is kept.
//! * INTO WHAT — the stream's buffer, through the same append a direct put uses
//!   (`crate::state::push_record`), so from the buffer on a source-fed stream and a
//!   `DirectPut` stream are one path: the destination, the `BufferingHints` window and the
//!   error output of [`crate::state::delivery`] apply to both without knowing where the
//!   records came from.
//!
//! A record the buffer has no room for leaves its shard position where it was, so the next
//! poll takes it again rather than losing it — the buffer budget delays a record, it never
//! drops one.
//!
//! ## The clock
//!
//! Consumption is continuous on the real service and no further Firehose call is made for a
//! source-fed stream, so it is driven by the one in-process task
//! ([`crate::state::delivery::drive_delivery_clock`]), which polls each source every
//! [`SOURCE_POLL_SPAN`] and then delivers whatever that made due. Nothing here sleeps, and a
//! poll writes only what the source already held at the instant it is given.
//!
//! ## Lock order
//!
//! Three steps, each holding ONE store's lock: this service's store is read for the sources
//! it has, the Kinesis service's store is then read for their new records, and this service's
//! store is locked again to buffer them. The two locks are never held at once, and nothing in
//! the Kinesis service reaches into this one, so a cycle between them is unreachable.
