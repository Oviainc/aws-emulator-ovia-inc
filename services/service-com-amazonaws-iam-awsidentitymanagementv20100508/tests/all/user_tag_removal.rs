//! `UntagUser`, end to end over the awsQuery wire, read back through `GetUser` and
//! `ListUserTags`.
//!
//! RULE under test: an untag call drops from the resource's stored tag set exactly
//! the tags whose keys it names, comparing keys exactly, and leaves every other
//! held tag with its value — so a named key the resource does not hold removes
//! nothing and the call still succeeds, which makes it idempotent, and the keys it
//! did remove are free to be tagged again. `UntagUser`'s own documentation:
//! "removes the specified tags from the user", with "the tags with matching keys
//! are removed from the specified user" (`UntagUser$TagKeys`).
//!
//! Every assertion drives a `MultiServiceRouter` holding this service over one
//! shared `InMemoryEngine`, exactly as the production router does, so what is under
//! test is the HTTP behaviour of a user that was PERSISTED rather than a handler
//! called directly. The awsQuery harness is the one `tests/all/user_lifecycle.rs`
//! owns, the entity-independent tag builders are `tests/all/role_tags.rs`'s, the
//! entity-independent tag-key-list builders and quota fixture are
//! `tests/all/role_tag_removal.rs`'s, and the user fixtures and the `GetUser` tag
//! reader are `tests/all/user_tags.rs`'s, so a request is built and read exactly one
//! way across this crate.
//!
//! The suites are tables whose rows differ along what the rule generalises over:
//! the held tag count, how many keys one call names, whether a named key is held or
//! not, the case of a key, the user's path, the case the user name is spelled in,
//! the number of calls, the alphabet and length bounds `tagKeyType` publishes
//! (1..128), and the published per-resource tag quota.
