//! The ONE judgement both preview operations make about a preview request's
//! selection.
//!
//! `ListAutomationRulePreview` reports the selected actions one by one and
//! `ListAutomationRulePreviewSummaries` aggregates the very same set, so the
//! rule under test is that one request shape is judged identically by both: a
//! selection one of them cannot evaluate is refused by the other with the same
//! status, the same error code and the same message, a selection either serves
//! is served by both, and a page token binds the selection it was taken with to
//! the operation that issued it.
//!
//! The table below drives each request shape through BOTH operations over the
//! wire — an awsJson1_0 `POST /` through the same router the emulator binary
//! mounts — and the rows differ along what the judgement spans: the required
//! action-type list, the organization scope read with the rule type, and each
//! form of criteria condition the protocol boundary admits (a condition with no
//! operator, with no values, with an operator from the wrong family, past the
//! documented size cap, and a tag condition with no key).
