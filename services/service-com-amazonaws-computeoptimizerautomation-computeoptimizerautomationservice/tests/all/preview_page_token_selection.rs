//! What a preview page token binds itself to: the SELECTION the walk is
//! performed over, not the request's spelling of it.
//!
//! The rule under test: a paginated preview's token carries the selection the
//! handler derives from the request — the accounts the rule type and
//! `organizationScope` cover, the requested action types, and the criteria after
//! defaulting, with a criterion that holds no condition read as the absent one
//! it is equivalent to — so any two requests that derive the SAME selection
//! continue one walk, while a request deriving a different selection (or the
//! sibling preview operation) is refused the token.
//!
//! Both preview operations are driven for every row, over the wire (an
//! awsJson1_0 `POST /` through the same router the emulator binary mounts), so
//! the two cannot drift apart over which requests continue one walk. The
//! recorded case the issue reports is one row of the equivalence table; the rows
//! differ along what the rule generalises over: which optional member is spelled
//! two ways (`criteria`, a criterion inside it, `organizationScope`), and
//! whether the spelling difference is an absent member, an empty object or a
//! rule type that derives the same account scope.
