//! Which CURSORS a paginated listing of this service accepts: the ones it could
//! itself have issued, and nothing else.
//!
//! The rule under test: a `nextToken` is this service's only when it is exactly
//! what `state::encode_page_token` writes for a cursor — the lowercase hex of
//! `<offset>:<fingerprint>`, the offset in the single spelling `usize`'s
//! `Display` renders — and only when the sequence it resumes REACHES the position
//! that cursor names, because a token is minted only while the walk still had an
//! item to resume at. Every other spelling of the same cursor, and every position
//! beyond the end of the walked sequence, is a token the listing never issued and
//! gets the one refusal it words for those: HTTP 400,
//! `InvalidParameterValueException`, and the crate's validation report on
//! `nextToken`.
//!
//! The table spans the class rather than one token: the half of the token that is
//! re-spelled (the decimal offset — a leading zero, several, a sign, surrounding
//! space, a digit separator, a radix prefix — and the hex around it, in the
//! uppercase digits the encoder never writes), the positions past the end
//! (just past it, well past it, and the largest a `usize` can carry), and the
//! operation it is driven through: EVERY paginated listing of this service, the
//! plain ones and the ones that GROUP before paging, each driven the way a client
//! drives it — an awsJson1_0 `POST /` through the same [`MultiServiceRouter`] the
//! emulator binary mounts. The decoder itself is then driven over a span of
//! offsets directly, where the round trip is the property: every cursor the
//! encoder writes decodes back to itself, and no re-spelling of one decodes at
//! all.
