//! A page token belongs to ONE walk: the OPERATION that issued it as well as the
//! query it was taken with.
//!
//! Every paginated operation of this service
//! (`smithy_query(query="digest")` marks nine of them `@paginated`) mints an
//! opaque `nextToken` that carries a fingerprint of the walk it resumes, and
//! accepts a token only when that fingerprint is the one it would itself have
//! minted. The operation is part of that fingerprint, so a token one listing
//! issued is refused by every other listing of the service even when the two
//! page over the same query members — `ListAutomationEvents` and
//! `ListAutomationEventSummaries` take the same filters and window over the same
//! events, and `ListRecommendedActions` and `ListRecommendedActionSummaries` the
//! same filter list, so without the issuing operation in the fingerprint one
//! would resume the other's walk and answer a page of a different result set.
//!
//! The rule is asserted twice over. First end to end: a token each listing
//! really minted is presented to every paginated operation of the service, where
//! only the one that issued it resumes. Then on the fingerprint itself, over a
//! table of listings and queries: a cursor carrying the digest of the query
//! members ALONE — the fingerprint a listing that bound no operation identity
//! would have issued — is refused, while the same cursor with the issuing
//! operation bound in is served. That table names EVERY paginated operation of
//! the service (asserted below against the one table of them), so no listing can
//! bind its query alone without a case here failing — whichever shape of query it
//! pages under, and whether it digests that query itself or through
//! `state::preview_selection_fingerprint`.
