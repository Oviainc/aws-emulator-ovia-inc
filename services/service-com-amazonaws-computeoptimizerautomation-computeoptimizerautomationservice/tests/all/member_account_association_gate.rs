//! The ASSOCIATION gate on initiating automation work, across a member
//! account's WHOLE INVENTORY and across SEVERAL accounts at once.
//!
//! The rule under test is the one `member_account_initiation_gate` pins for one
//! action per association state: the two operations that initiate automation
//! work in an account — the on-demand automation of a recommended action, and
//! the rollback of an automation event — act in an account OTHER than the
//! caller's only while that account is currently associated. This suite takes
//! that rule across the dimensions one row of that table cannot show: EVERY
//! recommended action of a member account rather than its first, so the gate is
//! the account's standing and not a property of one action; and several member
//! accounts in one organization, so a removal is judged per account and leaves
//! another member's actions, and the caller's own, exactly as reachable as they
//! were.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire: an awsJson1_0 `POST /` through the same
//! [`MultiServiceRouter`] the emulator binary mounts, through the harness
//! `automation_rule_lifecycle` owns and the opted-in router
//! `recommended_action_inventory` owns (opting in over the wire is what records
//! the caller's own analysed inventory).
