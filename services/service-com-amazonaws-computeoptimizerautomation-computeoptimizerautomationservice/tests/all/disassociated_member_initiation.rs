//! What a REFUSED initiation leaves behind, and what a removed association does
//! NOT take away.
//!
//! The gate `member_account_initiation_gate` pins — automation work is initiated
//! in another account only while that account is currently associated — is about
//! INITIATING work. This suite pins its two consequences:
//!
//! * a removal takes nothing out of the STORE: the member account's analysed
//!   actions are still held, by the same ids, so the association alone decides
//!   what the organization retrieves (they come back, unchanged, the moment the
//!   account is associated again) and a start of one of them is refused for the
//!   caller's standing rather than answered "no such resource"; the automation
//!   events the account already ran stay readable throughout, because an event
//!   is a resource of its own;
//! * a refused start consumes nothing, its `clientToken` included, so the same
//!   request is served once the association is back and a retry of it answers
//!   that one automation instead of starting a second.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire: an awsJson1_0 `POST /` through the same
//! [`MultiServiceRouter`](smithy_server_runtime::MultiServiceRouter) the
//! emulator binary mounts, through the harness `automation_rule_lifecycle` owns
//! and the opted-in router `recommended_action_inventory` owns. The helpers are
//! the ones `member_account_association_gate` owns, so the two suites drive the
//! service the same way.
