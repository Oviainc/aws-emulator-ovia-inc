//! The RETRIEVAL SCOPE of every selection over the recommended-action store.
//!
//! The rule under test: a caller selects the analysis output of its OWN account
//! and of each member account whose association is in place at the time of the
//! call, and of no other account — the association is read per call, never
//! inferred from the action being stored. It holds for every operation that
//! SELECTS over the store, so the table below takes each row through all four of
//! them: `ListRecommendedActions`, `ListRecommendedActionSummaries` (whose
//! counts and savings cover exactly the actions the listing reports) and the two
//! rule previews (whose selection is what a rule would act on, so a scope naming
//! an account the caller may not be scoped to previews nothing of it).
//!
//! The rows differ along the dimension the rule generalises over — which
//! accounts are reachable at the moment of the call — and walk an organization
//! through association, removal of one member, removal of the other, and a
//! re-association, so no row is a property of one account or of one order of
//! calls.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire: an awsJson1_0 `POST /` through the same
//! [`MultiServiceRouter`] the emulator binary mounts, through the harness
//! `automation_rule_lifecycle` owns and the opted-in router
//! `recommended_action_inventory` owns (opting in over the wire is what records
//! the caller's own analysed inventory). Nothing reaches into the store, so each
//! row is judged on association state its own calls put there.
