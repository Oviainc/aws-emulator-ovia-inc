//! How a stream session's placement resolves, end to end over the same router the
//! emulator serves.
//!
//! The rule under test: `StartStreamSession` persists a session in `ACTIVATING`
//! status — "Amazon GameLift Streams creates the stream session resource ... and
//! begins searching for available stream capacity to run the stream" — and the
//! placement then resolves against the capacity the hosting stream group holds.
//! "If Amazon GameLift Streams is successful in finding capacity for the stream,
//! the stream session status changes to ACTIVE status"; "if Amazon GameLift Streams
//! was not successful in finding capacity ..., the stream session status changes to
//! ERROR status and StartStreamSession returns a StatusReason of placementTimeout".
//! A session that is placed carries NO `StatusReason` — that member is "a short
//! description of the reason the stream session is in ERROR status or TERMINATED
//! status" — and a session whose `SignalRequest` carries no WebRTC offer the stream
//! server could answer fails with the modelled `invalidSignalRequest` instead.
//! `internalError` ("An internal service error occurred") is a service fault and is
//! never the outcome of a placement a request and the stored capacity decide.
//!
//! The tables span that class. The first differs along WHICH capacity member a
//! location is configured through and how large it is (always-on, on-demand, a
//! maximum, a combination, and none at all), and along how many streams are asked
//! for against it; the second differs along the FORM of the signal request (a JSON
//! session description, a bare SDP offer, the documented no-client sentinel, and
//! four kinds of value that are no offer at all). The last test follows a placed
//! session through the operations a live stream gates.
//!
//! Every assertion reads a RESPONSE BODY, through `GetStreamSession`, so a
//! placement that moved nothing in state fails here.
