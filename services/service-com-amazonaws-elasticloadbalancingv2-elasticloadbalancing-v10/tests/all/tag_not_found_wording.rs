//! The WORDING of the `NotFound` a tag operation answers for a resource the store does
//! not hold.
//!
//! The rule under test is not one call: the tag operations select the resources they act
//! on through a LIST (`AddTags`, `RemoveTags` and `DescribeTags` all take
//! `ResourceArns`), so the refusal is about the request's whole selection rather than one
//! resource the call addresses, and Elastic Load Balancing names no value in it — the
//! collection-level wording of the resource kind, which is fixed text. So the table below
//! spans what the rule generalizes over: all three tag operations, every taggable kind,
//! several ARN forms per kind (including a load balancer that was created and deleted),
//! and selections of one, several and a live resource beside an absent one — the recorded
//! call (one deleted load balancer named by `AddTags`) is one row of it.
//!
//! The boundary is asserted too: an operation that addresses exactly ONE resource through
//! its own required identifier still quotes that identifier, so this wording is a property
//! of the list-shaped selector and not of the service.
//!
//! Every request goes through the router exactly as a client's would — awsQuery form body
//! in, an `<ErrorResponse>` envelope out — and the helpers are the ones the sibling tag
//! suites already carry (`provisioning_loop`, `resource_tags`, `tag_writes`,
//! `tag_removal`), so the calls under test are built exactly as those suites build them.
