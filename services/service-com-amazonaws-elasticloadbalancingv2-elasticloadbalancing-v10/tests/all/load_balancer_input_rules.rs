//! What `CreateLoadBalancer` accepts, and what it refuses before it mints anything.

//! Every rule under test is a clause of this operation's OWN modelled documentation, and
//! each is asserted over a TABLE whose rows differ along what the clause generalises over
//! — the length, the characters and the prefix of a name; the family and the scheme a
//! subnet mapping's pinned address is documented for; the number of subnets a family may
//! be placed in; the IP address type a scheme may carry:
//!
//! * `Name` — "can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric
//!   characters or hyphens, must not begin or end with a hyphen, and must not begin with
//!   `internal-`", and "must be unique per region per account", which is the duplicate
//!   refusal and the documented idempotent repeat;
//! * `SubnetMappings` — "[Application Load Balancers] ... You can't specify Elastic IP
//!   addresses for your subnets", "[Gateway Load Balancers] ... You can't specify Elastic
//!   IP addresses for your subnets", and "[Network Load Balancers] ... one Elastic IP
//!   address per subnet ... for your internet-facing load balancer. For internal load
//!   balancers, you can specify one private IP address per subnet ... For internet-facing
//!   load balancer, you can specify one IPv6 address per subnet";
//! * `IpAddressType` — "Internal load balancers must use ipv4";
//! * `CanonicalHostedZoneId` — the Route 53 hosted zone Elastic Load Balancing publishes
//!   for the load balancer's Region and family.
//!
//! A refused create must also store NOTHING, so every refusal row reads the name back
//! through `DescribeLoadBalancers` and expects the not-found refusal. Every request goes
//! through the router exactly as a client's would — awsQuery form body in, XML out — and
//! the harness is `all/provisioning_loop.rs`'s, reused rather than written twice.
