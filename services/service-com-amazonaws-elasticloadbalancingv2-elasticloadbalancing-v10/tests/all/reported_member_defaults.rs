//! The members every answer of these reads CARRIES, over the wire.
//!
//! Three readings of one rule: a member whose value AWS always has for the resource is
//! reported on every answer, never left out for the client to supply itself.
//!
//! * `LoadBalancer$EnablePrefixForIpv6SourceNat` has a documented default ("the default
//!   value is `off`"), so every load balancer reports it — and reports what a caller set
//!   once one of the two operations the model gives the member (`CreateLoadBalancer`,
//!   `SetSubnets`) sets it.
//! * `DescribeCapacityReservationResult$DecreaseRequestsRemaining` is the account's
//!   allowance for the DAY, so it is reported for every load balancer, including one that
//!   reserves no capacity and so has nothing to decrease.
//! * `TargetHealthDescription$HealthCheckPort` ("the port to use to connect with the
//!   target") follows the target group's health-check configuration read against the
//!   target the request named, which every described target has — a registered one and an
//!   unregistered one alike.
//!
//! The DNS name a load balancer publishes is the other half of this issue and has its own
//! suite (`load_balancer_dns_name_form.rs`).
//!
//! The wire harness (`emulator`, `call`, `action`, `p`, `members`, `first_text`) comes from
//! `provisioning_loop` and the load balancer creator from `load_balancer_attributes`;
//! nothing here restates either.
