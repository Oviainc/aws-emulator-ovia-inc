//! The TARGET HEALTH state machine of a target group, driven over the wire exactly as a
//! client drives it: `RegisterTargets`, `DeregisterTargets`,
//! `ModifyTargetGroupAttributes` and `DescribeTargetHealth`.
//!
//! Two rules are asserted here, each over a SET of inputs rather than over the one call a
//! recording happens to carry:
//!
//! * DEREGISTRATION. A registration a load balancer is sending traffic to enters
//!   `draining` (reason `Target.DeregistrationInProgress`) when it is deregistered,
//!   receives no new request, and leaves the target group once that group's
//!   `deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds` has passed — so a client that drains
//!   connections before tearing a target down can observe the drain. A registration
//!   nothing is sending traffic to (a target group no load balancer forwards to, or a
//!   delay of zero) has no connections to drain and leaves the group at once.
//! * THE SETTLING SPAN. Health checking on a registration BEGINS when the registration is
//!   made or when the target group first becomes one a load balancer forwards to,
//!   whichever is later — so the first state reported after the attach is `initial`
//!   (reason `Elb.RegistrationInProgress`) and only then `healthy`. Before any load
//!   balancer forwards to the group nothing is checking its targets at all, which is
//!   `unused`/`Target.NotInUse`.
//!
//! The rows differ along what those rules generalise over: the configured delay (the
//! documented default, an hour, a minute, a second, none at all, and a value no
//! deregistration can drain for), whether the group is one a load balancer forwards to,
//! how the association was made (a listener's default action or a rule's), how many
//! registrations the group holds, and how many deregistrations one registration gets.
//!
//! The spans are the service's own: the deregistration delay is the value the attribute
//! carries, and the settling span is `state::SETTLE_AFTER` — read from the crate rather
//! than restated, so these rows cannot drift from the handler.
