//! What a reported FORWARD ACTION and a reported LISTENER carry, driven over the wire
//! exactly as a client drives them.
//!
//! Two rules are asserted here, each over a SET of inputs rather than over the one call a
//! recording happens to carry:
//!
//! * A forward action's distribution has TWO SPELLINGS — `Action$TargetGroupArn` for a
//!   single target group and `ForwardActionConfig$TargetGroups` for any number of them —
//!   so every reply that serializes such an action reports it under both, with each target
//!   group carried at the weight the request gave it or at the one the service distributes
//!   an unweighted group at, and with the stickiness the request configured or the one a
//!   forward is carried at until a request turns it on. A forward among SEVERAL groups has
//!   no single-group spelling, so that member stays absent for it.
//! * A listener's `MutualAuthentication` belongs to the listeners the model brackets the
//!   member to ("[HTTPS listeners] The mutual authentication configuration information"),
//!   so a read of such a listener reports the client certificate handling it is effectively
//!   under — the documented default mode for a listener nothing configured mTLS on — and a
//!   listener outside that bracket reports no such block at all.
//!
//! The rows differ along what those rules generalise over: which spelling the request used
//! (one, the other, or both), how many target groups a forward distributes among, whether
//! each carries a weight and which weight (both published bounds of the documented range
//! included), whether stickiness is configured and at which duration, the listener
//! protocol, the mutual authentication mode, and which operation reports the action (the
//! create, the modification, a priority move, a read by ARN and a read of the whole
//! listener — on a listener's default actions, on a rule a caller added, and on the rule
//! the listener mints with itself).
