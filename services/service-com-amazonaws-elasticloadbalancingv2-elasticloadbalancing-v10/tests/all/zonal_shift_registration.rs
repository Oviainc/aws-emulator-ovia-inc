//! Whether a load balancer of this service is a MANAGED RESOURCE of Amazon Application

//!
//! RULE: turning zonal-shift integration on for a load balancer — the
//! `zonal_shift.config.enabled` attribute, "Indicates whether zonal shift is enabled" —
//! makes it one of the resources ARC manages, so the load balancer is recorded in the ONE
//! shared registry ARC reads, under its own ARN and name and spanning the Availability
//! Zones this store puts it in; the integration turned off, the load balancer deleted, or
//! an attribute write that never names the key leaves it unregistered, and a load balancer
//! given different subnets is recorded again with the zones it now spans.
//!
//! The registry is read here exactly as ARC reads it, from the resource side. The zones
//! asserted on are the ones this service ANSWERED for the load balancer, never a value
//! this suite made up: with no EC2 mounted beside it the zone a subnet puts a load balancer
//! in is the zone NAME this store holds, which is what is recorded for a subnet no
//! Availability Zone ID is known for. The other half of the rule — the zone IDs EC2 reports
//! for real subnets, and ARC answering on them — is
//! `core/router/tests/all/elbv2_zonal_shift_managed_resource.rs`.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the TYPE of load balancer (both
//! the families the attribute's documentation lists, plus the one that carries no such
//! attribute at all), how MANY subnets it is placed in, and the value the attribute is
//! written with.
