//! The load balancer's OWN elastic network interfaces, in the inventory EC2 holds.
//!
//! A load balancer is reached at an ADDRESS inside the VPC it is placed in: Elastic Load
//! Balancing puts one service-managed elastic network interface in each subnet the load
//! balancer is attached to, takes a private address of that subnet for it, and those
//! interfaces are ordinary describable EC2 network interfaces — the model itself carries the
//! `NetworkInterfaceType` values a load balancer's interface is of
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape",shape="NetworkInterfaceType")`: `load_balancer`,
//! `network_load_balancer`) and marks one a service created and manages through
//! `NetworkInterface$RequesterId` / `NetworkInterface$RequesterManaged`. So a client doing an
//! address-level diagnosis of its VPC — which interface is the load balancer, which address
//! belongs to it — finds them with `DescribeNetworkInterfaces`.
//!
//! Those interfaces are not this service's records: they live in the account's EC2 inventory,
//! the one `DescribeNetworkInterfaces` answers from, so they are written there — exactly as
//! another service's endpoint addresses are — rather than kept in a copy of this store that
//! no reader of that inventory can see. [`release_load_balancer_interfaces`] is the exact
//! reverse: the interfaces carry the load balancer's traffic, so they do not outlive it.
//!
//! LOCKING. The EC2 store lock is taken for one placement or release and dropped before
//! returning. The caller may hold this service's own store, so the order is always this
//! service and then EC2; EC2 never reaches this service, so no cycle exists.
