//! End-to-end tests for how the catalog operations resolve the engine version they
//! are asked about: `DescribeInstanceTypeLimits` and `ListInstanceTypeDetails`,
//! against the set `ListVersions` advertises.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a
//! client sees, not what a handler returns. The harness comes from
//! [`super::domain_lifecycle`]; this suite adds no second copy of it.
//!
//! The rule under test: an operation that reports what the service offers FOR a named
//! engine release resolves that release against the catalog of releases the service
//! publishes — the same set `ListVersions` advertises — and refuses a value the
//! catalog does not hold with HTTP 400 `ValidationException`, naming the value asked
//! for and the catalog it was resolved against. `VersionString`'s own pattern
//! (`^Elasticsearch_[0-9]{1}\.[0-9]{1,2}$|^OpenSearch_[0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]{1,2}$`, from
//! `smithy_query(query="operation",operation="DescribeInstanceTypeLimits")`) admits
//! every `Elasticsearch_X.Y` and `OpenSearch_X.Y` value, so satisfying it is not
//! resolving: the two must not disagree about which engines exist.
//!
//! So the assertions span SETS of inputs: every version the emulator itself
//! advertises is answered by both operations, and a table of well-formed versions
//! outside the catalog — a far-future major, a minor its line skips, a minor of each
//! engine line that was never published, a two-digit major — is refused by both, each
//! refusal carrying exactly the advertised catalog.
