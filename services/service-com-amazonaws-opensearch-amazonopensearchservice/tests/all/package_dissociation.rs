//! End-to-end tests for taking a package OFF a domain: `DissociatePackages` and
//! `DissociatePackage`.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a
//! client sees, not what a handler returns. The harness comes from
//! [`super::domain_lifecycle`] and the package helpers from
//! [`super::package_associations`]; this suite adds no second copy of either.
//!
//! The tests assert RULES over sets of inputs, not one recorded call:
//!
//! * a dissociation removes the link the call names and answers with the stored
//!   record, over a table of calls spanning every `PackageType` value, batches of
//!   one, two and four packages, and BOTH wire forms (the one that unlinks several
//!   packages and the one that unlinks a single package);
//! * the link is left in a transient status and the clock owes it the removal that
//!   takes the package off the domain: every row is `DISSOCIATING` the instant the
//!   call returns and gone once the span has passed, without any call having asked
//!   for the move;
//! * a dissociation is refused while another change to one of the domain's
//!   associations has not landed yet — the association being put in place, and the
//!   removal of any other package — and the change in flight still lands;
//! * a request that cannot be served dissociates NOTHING, over the ways it cannot be
//!   served — including a `PackageList` longer than the packages the account holds —
//!   each with the status and error code the model declares.
//!
//! The domain's associations are read back over the wire: `ListPackagesForDomain` and
//! `ListDomainsForPackage` must both stop reporting a link once the clock has taken it
//! off, and a second dissociation of a link that is gone is refused — with the store
//! (reached exactly as a handler reaches it) used only to assert what no accepted call
//! has yet made observable.
