//! End-to-end tests for the CURRENT GENERATIONS of the instance-type catalog
//! `ListInstanceTypeDetails` publishes.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a
//! client sees, not what a handler returns. The harness comes from
//! [`super::domain_lifecycle`]; this suite adds no second copy of it.
//!
//! The rule asserted here: the catalog a release's listing reports is the catalog the
//! SERVICE publishes for that release, so it carries every current-generation family
//! the service accepts an instance type of — not only the families the checked-in
//! `OpenSearchPartitionInstanceType` value set enumerates, which is an older snapshot
//! of the same catalog. [`super::instance_type_catalog`] states the listing's shape,
//! order and feature members over the whole catalog; this suite is the table of the
//! current-generation families themselves, each row asserting that the family is
//! published, that the release before its prerequisite does not offer it, that the
//! `instanceType` filter reports the entry the listing reports, and that the entry
//! carries the node roles an instance of the family serves.
//!
//! Source of the table: the instance types the service's own accepted-value list
//! reports — the value set its refusal of an unknown `instanceType` enumerates, which
//! is the service's record of what it accepts and carries the seventh-generation Intel,
//! Graviton3, Graviton4, dense-storage and second-generation OpenSearch-optimized
//! families the checked-in enum does not list. The sizes each family is published in
//! are the service's published ladder for it, as [`ListInstanceTypeDetails`] reports
//! them; this suite reads them back from the answer rather than restating them.
