//! End-to-end tests for `DescribeInsightDetails`.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a
//! client sees. The harness and the baseline `CreateDomain` body come from
//! [`super::domain_lifecycle`], and the refusal assertion from [`super::insights`];
//! this suite adds no second copy of either.
//!
//! The rule under test: a detail read reports the detail fields persisted on the ONE
//! insight the entity the request names holds under the requested id — each field as
//! its stored name, type and value, in the order the insight holds them — rendering
//! each value with the markup the field carries when the request asks for HTML content
//! and as plain content otherwise; the insight is addressed by the ENTITY and the id
//! together, and an ENTITY this read cannot resolve is refused as ONE missing resource
//! naming neither half of the address, while an id that entity holds no insight under
//! is answered with the ONE field the service states about an insight's details rather
//! than refused; and nothing is written.
//!
//! So the assertions span a SET of inputs rather than one call: a table of fields
//! covering both values of `InsightFieldType`, a field with a marked-up rendering and
//! fields without one, an empty value and a long one; then the three ways a request can
//! answer `ShowHtmlContent`, every entity type the model admits with the account named
//! both ways, five ids no entity holds an insight under against four entities that do
//! resolve, five entities this account holds nothing for, and an insight carrying no
//! detail field at all.
//!
//! The insights themselves are written into the store directly (through
//! [`super::domain_lifecycle::Emulator::store`]): the service RAISES an insight and its
//! fields from what it observes of a domain, so no wire call leaves one. Everything the
//! rule is asserted ON is read back through the wire.
