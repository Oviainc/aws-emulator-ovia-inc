//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-partnercentralchannel-partnercentralchannel service.
//!
//! This module owns everything the handlers in `src/ops/` share: the stored form of a
//! program management account and of a relationship (a relationship is modelled as a
//! CHILD of a program management account, so its ARN hangs off the parent's), the
//! stored form of a channel handshake, the
//! client-token (idempotency) ledger, the opaque page token the paginated lists hand
//! out, and the identifier resolution every operation needs — each identifier member
//! accepts either a bare id (`pma-…` / `rs-…`) or the full ARN.
//!
//! Ids are minted here from a counter held in this store, so every id and ARN the
//! service hands out is also stored here and can be resolved again. Handlers build
//! their own output shapes from what they read back out of here, never from the
//! request that created the record.
