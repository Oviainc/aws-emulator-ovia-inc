//! A Kinesis CHANNEL's CONFIGURATION CHANGES, end to end over the wire: `UpdateChannel` ->
//! `DescribeChannel`.
//!
//! RULE: an accepted `UpdateChannel` writes exactly the members its request names onto the
//! STORED channel — the data-freshness window of the destination the channel already delivers
//! to, and the CloudWatch Logs settings, where a log group or log stream name the request
//! omits keeps the value the channel already carries — leaves every other member exactly as
//! it was, and takes the channel out of `ACTIVE` into `UPDATING` until the transition it armed
//! falls due. A channel that is not `ACTIVE` admits no further change: it is refused with the
//! modelled `ResourceInUseException` at HTTP 400 and nothing is written. So of any number of
//! overlapping changes exactly one is admitted, and the channel settles on exactly that one
//! caller's values rather than on a mixture of several callers'. A request that names nothing
//! to update, or that names the destination the channel does not deliver to ("You cannot
//! change the destination ... of an existing channel", `UpdateChannel`), is
//! `InvalidArgumentException`; one naming a channel this account and region do not hold is
//! `ResourceNotFoundException`; and neither arms any transition.
//!
//! The recorded flow this was derived from races TWO `UpdateChannel` calls carrying
//! `S3DestinationConfiguration.DataFreshnessInSeconds` against ONE channel, which is one row
//! of the tables below. The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which updatable
//! member the request names (either destination's freshness window, the logging settings, or
//! both at once), the value it carries, whether the channel was already logging, which logging
//! names the request omits, the destination kind the channel delivers to, the lifecycle status
//! the channel is in when the call arrives, the region the request is signed for, and how many
//! callers overlap.
//!
//! Every case drives the real awsJson1_1 request path (`POST /` with `X-Amz-Target:
//! Kinesis_20131202.<Operation>` through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`), so the statuses,
//! bodies and modelled errors asserted here are the ones a client sees.
