//! UPDATING a registered thing group: what a change to a group record asks for, what
//! refuses one, and the single registry write that applies it.
//!
//! `UpdateThingGroup` "Update a thing group": it addresses a group by the name it was
//! created under — the `@httpLabel` of `/thing-groups/{thingGroupName}` — and carries
//! `thingGroupProperties` as a `@required` member, so the properties the request carries
//! are the properties the group has afterwards. `AttributePayload$merge` is the one
//! exception the model states: it "Specifies whether the list of attributes provided in
//! the `AttributePayload` is merged with the attributes stored in the registry, instead
//! of overwriting them", and the note on it names `UpdateThingGroup` as one of the two
//! operations the flag is valid for, so without it the provided list OVERWRITES what the
//! record held.
//!
//! The update runs under OPTIMISTIC CONCURRENCY the same way a thing's does:
//! `UpdateThingGroup$expectedVersion` is "The expected version of the thing group. If
//! this does not match the version of the thing group being updated, the update will
//! fail."
//!
//! The write lives here rather than in the handler for the same reason
//! [`super::ComAmazonawsIotAwsiotserviceState::update_thing`] does: it is the registry's
//! own rule about which changes a group record takes, and a handler maps the refusal onto
//! the error ITS model declares.
