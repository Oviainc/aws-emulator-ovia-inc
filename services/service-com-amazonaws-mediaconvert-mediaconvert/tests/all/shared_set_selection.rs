//! End-to-end HTTP coverage of the ONE set-selection path the `listBy` listings share.
//!
//! Every case drives the real restJson1 wire path — the router picks the service from the
//! request's SigV4 scope, the framework deserializes and validates, the handler runs, and
//! the response is serialized — so what is asserted is the bytes a client would see.
//!
//! The rule under test, which every row below is one case of: a listing taking `listBy` and
//! `category` reports the built-in records when `listBy` names the built-in set and the
//! account's own records for every other value of it (including none at all, which names
//! only an ordering key), keeping only the records stored under exactly the `category` the
//! request names, and keeping every one of them when it names none.
//!
//! The rows span the two operations that reach that path — `ListJobTemplates` and
//! `ListPresets` — against both kinds of record, the three `listBy` values, both `Order`
//! directions, a category two records share, a category one record holds, a record stored
//! under no category at all, and categories that differ from a stored one only in case or
//! by a suffix. So a change to which set a `listBy` value selects, or to how `category`
//! matches, cannot land in one listing and miss the other.
//!
//! The account's own records are seeded straight into the store, as the listing suites
//! beside this one do; the write side's own coverage lives in
//! `tests/all/job_template_crud.rs` and `tests/all/preset_lifecycle.rs`. The built-in
//! records are the ones the account comes up with, and their names are read out of the
//! store rather than written down here. Nothing else here reaches past HTTP.
