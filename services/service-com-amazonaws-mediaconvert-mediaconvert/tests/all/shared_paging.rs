//! End-to-end HTTP coverage of the ONE paging path every listing of this service shares.
//!
//! Every case drives the real restJson1 wire path — the router picks the service from the
//! request's SigV4 scope, the framework deserializes and validates, the handler runs, and
//! the response is serialized — so what is asserted is the bytes a client would see.
//!
//! The rule under test, which every row below is one case of: a paged listing reports its
//! whole selected set, ordered on the key the request names and in the direction it names,
//! in pages of at most `maxResults`, each page carrying an opaque `nextToken` that resumes
//! immediately after its last item and carrying none when the page is the last — so the
//! same set comes back in the same order whatever page size the caller walks it with, and
//! a token this service never issued is refused.
//!
//! The rows span the listings that reach that path from different operations — job
//! templates, presets, queues and the Job engine version catalogue — the page sizes 1
//! through the default 20, both `Order` directions and both `listBy` keys, so a change to
//! the ordering, the anchor comparison, the page-size fallback or the token condition
//! cannot land in one listing and miss another.
//!
//! The account's own job templates, presets and queues are seeded straight into the store
//! at the creation instants each case needs, as the ordering suites beside this one do; the
//! write side's own coverage lives in `tests/all/job_template_crud.rs`,
//! `tests/all/preset_lifecycle.rs` and `tests/all/queue_update.rs`. The version catalogue is
//! the one the account comes up with. Nothing else here reaches past HTTP.
