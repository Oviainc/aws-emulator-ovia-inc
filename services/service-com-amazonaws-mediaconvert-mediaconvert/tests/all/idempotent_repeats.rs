//! End-to-end HTTP coverage of the REPEATED request.
//!
//! The rule under test: a MediaConvert control-plane request whose effect is already
//! present in the store is answered with that operation's own success — a `Create*` whose
//! `Name` is already stored answers its 201 with the resource that is ALREADY there,
//! unchanged, and a delete or a cancel whose target is already in the state it asks for
//! answers its empty 202 — so a provisioning or teardown path that runs twice is never
//! handed a 4xx. Only a target the request can never reach stays refused: a name a
//! BUILT-IN resource holds (which no `Create*` minted, and which no caller may delete),
//! a queue that still owes work, and a job that left `SUBMITTED` for a status other than
//! `CANCELED`. The READ paths are untouched: a `Get*` of a resource that is not stored is
//! still the modelled 404.
//!
//! Every case drives the real restJson1 wire path through the router (the harness is the
//! one `job_lifecycle` builds), so what is asserted is the bytes a client would see. Two
//! assertions read the store directly, where the listing operation that would show it
//! over the wire (`ListQueues`, `ListPresets`) is still a 501 stub; they say so.
