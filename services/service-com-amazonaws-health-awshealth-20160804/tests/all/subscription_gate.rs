//! The account-level Amazon Web Services Support subscription gate, end to end over
//! the same router the emulator boots.
//!
//! RULE: the Health API is served only to an account holding a qualifying Amazon Web
//! Services Support plan; a call from an account without one is refused with HTTP 400
//! and the error code `SubscriptionRequiredException`, for EVERY operation the service
//! binds and before the request's input is validated, before any stored event is
//! looked up, and without changing anything the next caller reads.
//!
//! Source of the rule: this service's own documentation
//! (`smithy_query(query="doc",shape="AWSHealth_20160804")`) — "You must have a
//! Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from Amazon Web Services
//! Support to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web
//! Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
//! Support plan, you receive a `SubscriptionRequiredException` error."
//!
//! Each suite asserts that rule over a SET of inputs: the operation (every one the
//! service binds — implemented readers and stubs alike), the shape of the input
//! (complete, empty, outside a modelled bound, naming an event that does not exist),
//! and the plan the account holds (every plan the documentation names, in several
//! spellings, plus the plans that do not qualify).
