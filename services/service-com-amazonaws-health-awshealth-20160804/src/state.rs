//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-health-awshealth-20160804 service.
//!
//! AWS Health is a READ-ONLY API: it has no `Create*`/`Put*` operation, so the
//! resources every `Describe*` reports on are the events AWS itself publishes. The
//! emulator therefore installs a small, deterministic event catalog when this state
//! is first constructed ([`Default`]), and every operation computes its answer by
//! filtering/aggregating THAT catalog. No handler holds a canned response.
//!
//! This module owns the three things more than one handler needs:
//!
//! * the stored records ([`HealthEvent`], [`HealthEntity`]) and their projections
//!   onto the modelled wire shapes, so the `Event` `DescribeEvents` returns and the
//!   one `DescribeEventDetails` returns are built by the same function from the same
//!   record;
//! * filter evaluation ([`ComAmazonawsHealthAwshealth20160804State::matching_events`],
//!   [`ComAmazonawsHealthAwshealth20160804State::matching_entities`]); and
//! * pagination ([`paginate`]) with server-issued, verifiable opaque tokens.
//!
//! It also owns the one ACCOUNT-level fact the whole API is gated on: the Amazon Web
//! Services Support plan the account holds
//! ([`ComAmazonawsHealthAwshealth20160804State::support_plan`]), which
//! [`ComAmazonawsHealthAwshealth20160804State::health_api_allowed`] answers against
//! the plans this service's documentation names ([`QUALIFYING_SUPPORT_PLANS`]) and
//! `crate::service` reads ahead of every operation.
