//! `CreateApplication` writes an [`Application`] here, and `DescribeApplication`,
//! `ListApplications`, `StartApplication`, `StopApplication`, `UpdateApplication` and

//! there and `DeleteApplicationSnapshot` removes it.
//!
//! Beside the records themselves this module owns the two projections every reader
//! needs ([`Application::detail`], [`Application::summary`]), the per-version records a
//! version reader reports ([`Application::version_detail`],
//! [`Application::version_summaries`]), the tag list the tagging operations read and write
//! ([`Application::tag_list`]), the resolution of a `ResourceARN` to the application it
//! names ([`ComAmazonawsKinesisanalyticsv2Kinesisanalytics20180523State::application_by_arn`]),
//! the merge an update applies
//! to a stored configuration ([`Application::apply_configuration_update`]), the mode an
//! application runs in when its create named none ([`default_application_mode`]), the
//! maintenance window every application carries
//! ([`Application::maintenance_configuration`]), the resolution of a Studio notebook's
//! catalog against the Glue Data Catalog ([`catalog_database_refusal`]) and the
//! clock-owed status settlement
//! ([`ComAmazonawsKinesisanalyticsv2Kinesisanalytics20180523State::settle`]),
