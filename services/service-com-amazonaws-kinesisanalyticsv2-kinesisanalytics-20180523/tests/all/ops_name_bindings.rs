//! Every `crate::ops::<Name>` path of this service names exactly one item, and each
//! operation keeps its own handler.
//!
//! The rule: a name is published once under `crate::ops`, whichever generated glob
//! (`types::*` or `<snake_op>::*`) carries it, so no `crate::ops::<Name>` depends on the
//! order the ops-module generator emits those globs in. `crate::ops::<ShapeName>` names
//! the MODELLED SHAPE — the generated service declaration is expanded with
//! `types = "crate::ops"`, so that is the path the wire machinery resolves every
//! input/output shape through — and an operation's handler struct is reached at
//! `crate::ops::<snake_op>::<Op>` as well as through its glob.
//!
//! This model is one that could break the rule: `DeleteApplicationOutput` is an operation
//! AND the `<Op>Output` form of `DeleteApplication`'s output struct. It does not, because
//! that output struct carries the model's own output shape name
//! (`DeleteApplicationResponse`). The rows below span the class rather than that one
//! name: the operation whose name is at risk, the operation whose output struct yields
//! the name, two operations with no such tension (`AddApplicationOutput`,
//! `DeleteApplicationCloudWatchLoggingOption`), and every one of them driven over the
//! wire — `DeleteApplication` to a real 200 (it is implemented, so its success response
//! is serialized through its own output shape) and each scaffold to its own 501.
