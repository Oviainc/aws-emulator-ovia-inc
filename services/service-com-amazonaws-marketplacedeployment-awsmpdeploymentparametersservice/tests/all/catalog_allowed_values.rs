//! `catalog` is an ALLOWED-VALUE member, and naming no catalog is an input error.
//!
//! The rule under test: a request whose `catalog` names no catalog this service
//! serves (`state::SUPPORTED_CATALOGS`) is refused with the modelled
//! `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) BEFORE any product or agreement is resolved,
//! however well-formed the value is and whatever else the request carries — so a
//! client reading the error code can tell a wrong catalog (a permanent 400-class
//! input error) from a target the account does not hold (the 404
//! `ResourceNotFoundException`).
//!
//! Where the set comes from: `PutDeploymentParameterRequest$catalog` is documented
//! as "The catalog related to the request. Fixed value: `AWSMarketplace`"
//! (`smithy_query(query="doc",shape="PutDeploymentParameterRequest",member="catalog")`),
//! while the `Catalog` shape itself carries only the SYNTAX of a catalog name
//! (`length 1..64`, `^[a-zA-Z_-]+$`,
//! `smithy_query(query="shape",shape="Catalog")`). The two are different
//! judgements and this suite pins both: a value outside the syntax is refused as
//! that constraint (`validation_messages` states its message), and a value inside
//! the syntax but outside the set is refused as naming no catalog.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path through the harness the
//! `deployment_parameters` suite owns.
