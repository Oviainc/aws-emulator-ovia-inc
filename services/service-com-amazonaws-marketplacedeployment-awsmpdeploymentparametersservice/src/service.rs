//! The `com-amazonaws-marketplacedeployment-awsmpdeploymentparametersservice` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. Return `Some(op)` to route one yourself.
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## The front door
//!
//! This service is not reached directly: the AWS gateway in front of it judges the
//! request envelope BEFORE the service runs, and a request it will not forward is
//! refused with its own HTTP 403 `ForbiddenException` (`"Forbidden"`,
//! [`crate::scaffolded::FrontDoorRefusal::forbidden`]) — a shape the model does not
//! declare, carrying nothing of the request.
//!
//! What the gateway refuses here is an OVERSIZED `@sensitive` payload: a value past the
//! maximum length its modelled shape declares. Such a payload is dropped at the gateway
//! instead of being described back to the caller, so the answer is the opaque 403 rather
//! than the modelled 400 `ValidationException` the walk would otherwise state — which
//! for a `@sensitive` member could only name the member and the bound anyway (see
//! `constraint_clause` below). Every OTHER constraint violation, including one on the
//! same member for being too SHORT or for naming no supported value, stays the modelled
//! `ValidationException`.
//!
//! WHY THAT PREDICATE, and what is NOT claimed by it: what AWS recorded is one fact —
//! a secret past `SecretString`'s modelled maximum is answered 403 `ForbiddenException`
//! while an in-limit one reaches the service. AWS's own gateway rule behind that 403 is
//! not observable from here: a byte threshold on the whole body cannot be derived from
//! the recording either, because the in-limit request that DOES reach the service and
//! the over-limit one that does not differ by a single character, so no body size
//! separates them, and a threshold low enough to separate them would refuse requests the
//! model declares valid (a 15000-character secret, a full 50-entry tag map). So the
//! refusal is keyed to the one thing this emulator can observe and the model can state:
//! the modelled maximum of the payload the request would hand over, on the member whose
//! value may not be echoed. `@sensitive` is a STAND-IN for the unknown gateway rule — it
//! marks the payload a gateway treats as opaque — and the bound is read off the model,
//! never written here, so an oversized NON-sensitive member stays the modelled 400 until
//! a recording says otherwise.
//!
//! Which member that is comes from the MODEL's own trail to it ([`SENSITIVE_MEMBER_PATHS`])
//! and never from the text of a path segment: a segment inside a collection is a value the
//! caller chose, so an entry of a tag map keyed like a member name is still a tag, and an
//! entry of it outside its own modelled bounds is the modelled 400 `ValidationException`
//! with its value echoed like any other tag's.
//!
//! [`EmulatedService::front_door_refuses`] is that check, reached through
//! [`Service::override_operation`] because the refusal PRECEDES the modelled walk:
//! constraint validation runs before a handler, so no handler can answer ahead of it.
//! The request's auth schemes are unaffected — the router reads them off the MODELLED
//! operation the routing key names — so a front-door refusal is still only reached by a
//! request whose signature verified.
//!
//! ## Naming the request a response answers
//!
//! Every response AWS sends names the request it answered, in the response header this
//! protocol reports that id in (`x-amzn-RequestId`) — on a success and on a failure alike.
//! It is a property of the RESPONSE, not of any modelled shape: no output or error shape
//! of this model declares it, so no handler can set it, and the framework's restJson1
//! renderers do not write it.
//!
//! That rule is not stated here: `service_common::query_error_envelope` owns it for every
//! emulated service, and this file only chooses the report its protocol takes (the header
//! alone — restJson1 has no envelope element for the id) and wires it at the layers every
//! response of this service passes through, which are three:
//!
//! * [`RequestIdHeaderOperation`], the wrapper [`Service::override_operation`] hands the
//!   router in place of each modelled operation, covers everything an operation answers —
//!   a success, a modelled error, and a constraint refusal raised while that operation was
//!   being served;
//! * [`RequestIdEnvelopeDefinition::header_only`], the definition wrapper
//!   [`Service::definition`] hands back, covers a response NO operation produced: a
//!   routing failure, a transport failure detected up front, and a pre-dispatch
//!   authentication refusal;
//! * [`FrontDoorAnswer`] renders its own refusal, so it passes that response through the
//!   same [`with_request_id_header`] directly.
//!
//! Nothing else about a response changes: the status, the other headers and every byte of
//! the body stay as the renderer wrote them.
//!
//! ## The body a refused request is answered with
//!
//! The model marks BOTH members of `ValidationException` `@required`, so every refusal
//! answered as that shape names the member it is about as well as stating a sentence. The
//! framework's pre-dispatch renderer cannot: `Service::override_refusal`, its only seam,
//! carries a code and a message and nothing else. So every modelled operation is served
//! through [`ServedOperation`], which states that refusal itself — from the framework's
//! own deserializer and constraint walk, in the SAME envelope `override_refusal` words —
//! in the modelled shape. [`modelled_refusal`] owns it.
