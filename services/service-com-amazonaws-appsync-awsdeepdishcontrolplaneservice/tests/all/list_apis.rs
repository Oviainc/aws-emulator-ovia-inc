//! `ListApis`, end to end over HTTP: what a page holds, what resumes it, and which
//! listings are refused.
//!
//! The rule is stated over CLASSES of input rather than over the one request that
//! exposed the defect: a listing reports every `Api` this account holds — and only an
//! `Api`, never a GraphQL API, which is a resource of its own — in one order that does
//! not depend on how the caller pages, cut into a page of at most `maxResults` entries
//! (the modelled maximum when the request names none) and resumed by the `nextToken`
//! the previous page handed back, which is reported exactly while entries remain; each
//! entry is the record `GetApi` answers for that id; and the call is a pure read, so
//! paging leaves every later reader seeing the same set.
//!
//! The rows span:
//!
//! 1. the count of APIs the account holds — none, one, several, a count that pages
//!    several times over, and the whole of what an account may hold — so neither the
//!    page nor its cursor can be keyed to a single collection size;
//! 2. the `maxResults` the caller names — unspecified, and each of several values
//!    inside the modelled range, including its published bounds;
//! 3. the authorization configuration of the listed APIs, rotated across every
//!    `AuthenticationType` the model declares, so the projection cannot be keyed to one
//!    kind of API;
//! 4. the forms of a listing that cannot resume: tokens that name no page of the list,
//!    and a `maxResults` one past each published bound of its modelled range.
//!
//! The harness (`call`, `create_api`, `router`, `Answer`) is the error-contract suite's;
//! the Event API body builder and the authorization-type catalog are the Event API
//! suite's — reused rather than copied.
