//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-partnercentralbenefits-partnercentralbenefitsservice service.
//!
//! The service has two resources in this slice:
//!
//! * the **benefit catalog** — service-owned, read-only data. The API models no
//!   `CreateBenefit`, so the catalogs and the benefits inside them are seeded here, at
//!   state init, and `ListBenefits` reports them from the store like any other read. The
//!   **benefit allocations** AWS has granted are service-owned in the same way (the API
//!   models no `CreateBenefitAllocation`), so they are seeded beside the benefits they
//!   draw from and `ListBenefitAllocations` reports them from the store.
//! * the **benefit application** — created, updated, submitted and cancelled by the
//!   caller. Every application is stored exactly once, keyed by its
//!   `benappl-[0-9a-z]{14}` id inside the catalog it was created in, so each operation
//!   reads and writes the one record.
//!
//! Timestamps are stored as epoch MILLISECONDS (`i64`) and rendered into the modelled
//! `date-time` members with [`timestamp`] on the way out. Keeping an integer in the
//! store (rather than a `DateTime`) is what lets [`bump_millis`] guarantee an update is
//! *observably* later than the write before it even when both land inside one clock
//! tick.
