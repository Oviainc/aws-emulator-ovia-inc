//! The ORDER a refusal lists an enumerated type's admitted values in.
//!
//! The rule asserted here: a value outside a modelled enum is refused in AWS's
//! validation envelope whose requirement clause states the admitted set in the
//! order THIS SERVICE states that set in, which is a property of the enumerated
//! TYPE rather than of the member, the operation or the request that carried the
//! value — so every member targeting one enum reports the same bracketed list,
//! in the same order, whatever request carried it, and whatever order the model
//! happens to declare its members in. The service states most of its types
//! sorted, and the ones its own refusals are recorded stating otherwise in that
//! recorded order. The envelope, the echoed value, the lowerCamel member path
//! and the requirement's wording are the framework's; only the order inside the
//! brackets is this service's.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which enumerated type
//! the value belongs to (five of this model's, each declared in an order that is
//! NOT its sorted one for four of them), which operation and member carried it
//! (a top-level member, a member nested inside a structure), the value refused (a
//! name no enum carries, an admitted value in the wrong case, the empty string),
//! and the order the model declares the type in relative to the one the refusal
//! states — including the one type this service states in neither its declared
//! nor its sorted order. A second test holds ONE type's set to the order the
//! service states it in over every spelling of a refused value a caller can
//! send, with the set read off the service's own message rather than compared
//! against a literal.
//!
//! Each value set below names where its order comes from — the `smithy_query`
//! that gives the model's declaration order, and for the one type stated in
//! neither that nor the sorted order, the order this service's own refusals
//! state it in — so the test pins the order rather than restating whatever the
//! service produced.
