//! The destination-enablement wait, and then `GetTimeSeriesServiceStatistics`
//! period bucketing under a service selector, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives the SAME front door the production router does (the shared
//! harness in [`crate::xray_wire`]), so the assertions are about HTTP responses
//! rather than internal state. The two rules under test are the two halves of
//! the client flow an instrumentation automation runs:
//!
//! * `GetTraceSegmentDestination` reports the settled status (`ACTIVE`) for an
//!   account whose destination is in effect — the account default before
//!   anything configures one, and the configured destination once the switch has
//!   been applied — so a caller polling for the settled status always gets there
//!   in a BOUNDED number of reads. That poll is the only completion signal the
//!   model publishes for the switch (`TraceSegmentDestinationStatus` is
//!   `[PENDING, ACTIVE]`, `smithy_query(query="shape",
//!   shape="TraceSegmentDestinationStatus")`), so a status stuck at the
//!   transitional value is a caller that waits forever.
//! * with the destination settled, requests submitted through
//!   `PutTraceSegments` are counted into the `Period`-wide aggregation period
//!   that contains each request's `start_time`: requests in different periods
//!   occupy DISTINCT datapoints whose `Timestamp`s are one period grid apart,
//!   requests inside one period share its datapoint, and a selector naming a
//!   service that recorded nothing yields no datapoint carrying
//!   `ServiceSummaryStatistics`.
//!
//! `time_series_service_statistics.rs` owns the per-class counting rules (how a
//! throttle, an error and a fault are classified) and the unselected, edge and
//! group surfaces; this suite is about the periods a service's clean requests
//! land in, which is what the enablement flow blocks on reaching.
