//! How this service words a request the framework refused before any handler ran, and
//! the one input constraint it enforces more tightly than its public model states.
//!
//! The framework walks the modelled constraints and hands [`Refusal`] to `service.rs`
//! STRUCTURALLY — one [`Violation`] per offending value, carrying the path it sits at,
//! what it failed and what it held — and leaves the wording to the service, because no
//! model records it. This module is that wording for every modelled input constraint of
//! this service: ONE formatter, reached by every operation's boundary validation, so no
//! operation can word a refusal its own way.
//!
//! The dialect it implements, as CodeConnections states a refusal:
//!
//! * the envelope is the AWS framework's — `N validation error(s) detected: ` over one
//!   clause per violation — and a clause names the offending MEMBER PATH and the
//!   CONSTRAINT that member violated;
//! * a value outside a CONSTRAINT (`@length`, `@pattern`, `@range`, `@uniqueItems`) is
//!   reported WITHOUT the value: the clause reads `Value at '<path>' …`. The constraint
//!   and the member are what a caller has to act on, and the value is the caller's own
//!   request — often long (a 620-byte endpoint) and sometimes private — so quoting it
//!   back adds nothing and amplifies the request into the response;
//! * a value outside an ENUM's value set IS quoted (`Value '<value>' at '<path>' …`):
//!   such a value is one the service could not map to a member of the type at all, and
//!   the set it was checked against is only actionable beside the value that missed it;
//! * an ABSENT `@required` member is reported as the `null` it was — a fact of the
//!   request's shape rather than a value the caller sent;
//! * a `@pattern` requirement quotes the expression WITHOUT the `^` / `$` anchors the
//!   model spells it with ([`service_common::validation::unanchored`], this emulator's
//!   one statement of that rendering): a caller that lifts the advertised expression out
//!   of the message and re-applies it locally must get the expression the service
//!   advertises;
//! * an enum requirement reads `Member must be one of: [ … ]`, over the values of the type
//!   in the order this service advertises that value set in ([`advertised_enum_values`]),
//!   which for one of its types is not the order the model declares them in.
//!
//! Nothing here is keyed to an operation or to a recorded value: the rule is applied to
//! whatever [`Violation`] the walk produces, so it holds for every constrained member of
//! every operation of this service — a `ConnectionName`'s `@length`, a `HostArn`'s or a
//! `RoleArn`'s `@pattern`, a `MaxResults`' `@range`, a `ProviderType`'s or a
//! `SyncConfigurationType`'s value set alike.
//!
//! # The connection-scoped ARN expression
//!
//! One member class is held to more than its model states. The public Smithy model
//! targets every connection-ARN member at `ConnectionArn`, whose `@pattern` is the loose
//! `^arn:aws(-[\w]+)*:.+:.+:[0-9]{12}:.+$` — ANY ARN of any service with a 12-digit
//! account, so a host or repository-link ARN passed where a connection ARN belongs
//! satisfies it. The REPOSITORY-LINK surface refuses such an ARN as an input-constraint
//! violation ([`is_connection_arn`], run by its handlers), and a clause about a
//! connection-ARN member advertises the connection-scoped expression
//! ([`CONNECTION_ARN_PATTERN`]) rather than the model's generic one — the enforced check
//! and the advertised text are the SAME constant, so a caller of that surface that
//! re-applies the expression it was given reproduces the decision the service made.
//!
//! The advertised expression is the service's whichever operation refused, because the
//! framework hands this seam the violations and NOT the operation they came from, and
//! because the expression is a property of the ARN form rather than of one call. What
//! each operation ENFORCES is its own: the older CONNECTION surface (`GetConnection`,
//! `DeleteConnection`) resolves every ARN its model admits and answers this service's
//! fixed "no connection exists" sentence for one that resolves to nothing — recorded
//! behaviour, pinned by `tests/all/refusal_messages.rs` — so there a value that satisfies
//! the model's pattern but not the expression above is reported as an absent connection
//! rather than as invalid input, and only a value that misses the model's pattern too is
//! refused here at all.
//!
//! A violation class this module has no wording for declines the WHOLE refusal (`None`),
//! which keeps the framework's default sentence rather than inventing one:
//! [`ViolationKind`] is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so a class can be added upstream.
