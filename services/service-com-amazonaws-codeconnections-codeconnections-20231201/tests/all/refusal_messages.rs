//! How this service WORDS a refusal, over the wire.
//!
//! THE RULE: a CodeConnections refusal carries the FIXED template of the case it
//! refuses, interpolated only from the request and from the resource the service already
//! holds — never a sentence this emulator authored, and never a value AWS leaves out. The
//! refusals of the Git-sync surface (repository links and sync configurations) carry one
//! thing more: the service framework appends
//! ` (Service: CodeConnections; Status Code: <status>; Error Code: <exception>; Request ID: <id>; Proxy: null)`
//! to the message, whose request id is the only per-run field; the connection surface's
//! refusals are the bare sentence.
//!
//! Each test asserts the rule over a TABLE spanning what its template generalises over —
//! which ARN form resolved to nothing, which id, which owner/repository, which resource
//! name, which region the caller signed for. The case each recorded unit cited is one row
//! of its table.
//!
//! Every request goes through the real `MultiServiceRouter` dispatch, reusing the
//! `connection_lifecycle` suite's helpers, so these tests exercise the same path a signed
//! SDK request takes.
