//! The origin access control an origin NAMES, resolved against the account's controls,
//! end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! Every assertion goes through the router, so each case exercises routing, restXml
//! (de)serialization, the handler, the persisted state and serialization — the same path a
//! client takes. The rule under test is the one CloudFront states for a reference a
//! distribution configuration makes to an origin access control:
//!
//! * every call that STORES a submitted `DistributionConfig` resolves each
//!   `Origin$OriginAccessControlId` against the account's origin access controls, and a
//!   configuration naming one the account does not hold — never created, or created and
//!   since deleted — is refused with `InvalidOriginAccessControl` (HTTP 400) and stores
//!   nothing: no distribution is created, and the caller reference the refused request
//!   named is not spent either;
//! * an absent or empty `OriginAccessControlId` names no control at all, so it resolves to
//!   nothing and is accepted;
//! * the identical configuration naming a control the account DOES hold is accepted and
//!   reads back with that control on the same origins.
//!
//! The rows differ along everything the rule generalises over: HOW the named control fails
//! to resolve (a control that was deleted, an id in the shape this service mints that no
//! control was created under, a value in no such shape), WHERE in the origin list the
//! reference sits and how many origins carry it, the KIND of origin that carries it (an
//! Amazon S3 origin, which is what an origin access control is for, and a custom origin),
//! the configuration the live control itself was created with (every row of the origin
//! access control table), and WHICH call submits the configuration
//! (`CreateDistribution`, `CreateDistributionWithTags` and `UpdateDistribution`).
//!
//! The harness (the router, the request helpers and the control table) is the one the
//! distribution and origin access control suites use, reused rather than copied.
