//! `DeleteOriginAccessControl`, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! Every assertion goes through the router, so each case exercises routing, restXml
//! (de)serialization, the handler, the persisted state and serialization — the same path
//! a client takes. The rules under test are the ones CloudFront's origin access control
//! surface states for a delete:
//!
//! * a delete REMOVES the stored record, so it answers 204 with no body and every later
//!   read of that id answers `NoSuchOriginAccessControl` (404) while every other stored
//!   control stays readable at its own version — and the parameters the removed control
//!   held are free again, so a create repeating them is no longer the conflict it was;
//! * the delete is a conditional request on the control's current version: an `If-Match`
//!   that is missing or is not a version token at all is `InvalidIfMatchVersion` (400),
//!   one carrying a well-formed token that is not the current one is `PreconditionFailed`
//!   (412), and a refused delete changes nothing;
//! * an id no control holds is `NoSuchOriginAccessControl` (404);
//! * "You cannot delete an origin access control if it's in use. First, update all
//!   distributions to remove the origin access control from all origins, then delete the
//!   origin access control." — a control an origin of a stored distribution still names is
//!   `OriginAccessControlInUse` (409) and stays readable, and the same delete lands once
//!   no origin names it.
//!
//! The table rows differ along everything these rules generalise over: the configuration
//! deleted (every row of the lifecycle suite's table — each value of every enum the
//! configuration carries, and each description form), how many controls the account holds
//! around the one being deleted, the FORM the version token is presented in (absent, bare,
//! quoted, weak, malformed, stale), and where in a distribution's origin list the
//! reference to the control sits.
//!
//! The harness (the router, the request helpers and the control table) is the one the
//! origin access control lifecycle and distribution lifecycle suites use, reused rather
//! than copied.
