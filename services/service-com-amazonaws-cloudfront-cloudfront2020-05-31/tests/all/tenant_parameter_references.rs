//! A distribution configuration may reference a TENANT PARAMETER only where it declares
//! one, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! Every assertion goes through the router, so each case exercises routing, restXml
//! (de)serialization, the handler, the persisted state and serialization — the same path a
//! client takes.
//!
//! The rule under test: a multi-tenant distribution's configuration is a TEMPLATE — the
//! members that address the origin (`Origin$DomainName`, `Origin$OriginPath`) may name one of
//! the parameters its `TenantConfig$ParameterDefinitions` declares, and CloudFront
//! substitutes the value each tenant supplies
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape",shape="TenantConfig,ParameterDefinition,Origin")`). So a
//! configuration declaring `tenant-only` may reference exactly the names that list carries,
//! and one declaring `direct` — a standard distribution, which serves its own traffic rather
//! than a tenant's and has nothing substituted into it — may reference none at all. Either
//! way the create or update is refused `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) before anything is
//! stored: the standard distribution's refusal names the offending member, the multi-tenant
//! one names the list the parameter is missing from.
//!
//! The rows below span what the rule generalises over: which member carries the reference,
//! which mode the document declares (the member, and the member left out), whether any
//! definitions are declared at all, whether the referenced name is among them (including a
//! name differing from a declared one only in case, which `ParameterName`'s pattern
//! `^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$` admits as a name of its own), and how many references one member
//! carries. Every refusal is asserted to have left nothing behind, and every acceptance to
//! have stored the members verbatim.
//!
//! The wire harness is the lifecycle suite's and the configuration builder the
//! connection-mode suite's, reused rather than copied.
