//! The sentence this service refuses a value an enum-constrained member does not admit
//! with, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! The rule: a constraint-violation message lists the admitted values of the ENUM the
//! member targets in the order this API publishes that enum's values — a property of the
//! enum shape, not of the request that broke it — inside the fixed template "`N` validation
//! error[s] detected: Value '<value>' at '<member>' failed to satisfy constraint: Member
//! must satisfy enum value set: [<values>]", under HTTP 400 and `MalformedXML`.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over:
//!
//! * the ENUM, which is what the order belongs to: `FunctionStage` and `CachePolicyType`,
//!   whose published orders are not the orders the schema declares, and `IpAddressType` and
//!   `OriginAccessControlSigningProtocols`, which this API publishes in the order it
//!   declares them;
//! * the OPERATION and the BINDING the value travelled in — a member of a request document,
//!   a member nested inside a payload, a query parameter on a collection route and one
//!   beside a path label — which say nothing about the value set, so the same enum is listed
//!   alike in each and all of them answer the one code;
//! * the value set's SIZE (two, three and four values);
//! * the form the inadmissible value takes (another word, an admitted value in the wrong
//!   case, an admitted value with trailing text, the empty value), which the sentence
//!   echoes but which never changes the set.
