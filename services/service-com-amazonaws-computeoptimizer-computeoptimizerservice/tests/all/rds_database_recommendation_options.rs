//! Every assertion drives the service the way a client does — an awsJson1_0 `POST /` through

//!
//! Two rules are pinned, each over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded call:
//!
//! * the utilization projected onto a recommended DB instance class, and the performance risk
//!   that projection implies: the same work runs on whatever capacity the class provides, so
//!   a metric measuring a SHARE of the instance's capacity moves with the ratio of the two
//!   classes' capacities (capped at the whole of it) while a metric measuring the workload's
//!   own volume does not move at all, and the option's risk follows its most loaded share;
//! * the savings-estimation-mode preference: the savings members net of discounts are
//!   reported exactly where the preference records in force for the database activate them.
