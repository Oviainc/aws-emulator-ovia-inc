//! The CONVERSATION `UpdateProfileWithAgent` carries a chat-based profile update
//! over, and the words the agent answers one turn with.
//!
//! `UpdateProfileWithAgent` "updates a data transformation profile using chat-based
//! interaction with an agent" and "supports multi-turn conversations for iteratively
//! customizing profiles", and its input says how a turn is addressed: a
//! `ConversationId` (absent on the first turn, so the service mints one and reports
//! it back), and an `InputMessage` whose `Type` is either `normal` or
//! `confirmation_response`. Its `EndOfOutputEvent` says what a turn hands back: a
//! final response, the `Options` the next turn may answer with, and the conversation
//! the turn belonged to. Those four members together describe one loop — the agent
//! proposes a change and offers the options that answer it, and the turn that answers
//! one of them is the turn that WRITES — which is the loop this module holds the state
//! for. The conversation is the only thing a turn needs that is not in the profile
//! record, so it lives here beside it, in the same store every other handler reads.
//!
//! # What a confirmed turn writes, and what it does not
//!
//! No language model runs in this emulator, so the agent authors no mapping content:
//! a confirmed turn stamps the DRAFT's `ChangeDescription` with its own account of the
//! change and the instant it ran — both read back by
//! `GetDataTransformationProfile` and `ListDataTransformationProfileVersions` — and
//! leaves the DRAFT's files exactly as they stand. A caller that has mapping content
//! to store sends it to `UpdateDataTransformationProfile`, which replaces the DRAFT
//! with content the request carries. Nothing here invents mapping files, matches on
//! the caller's text, or echoes it back: the message `Body` is `@sensitive`, so a
//! turn retains its SIZE and its `Type` and never its text, and every sentence the
//! agent answers with is composed from the stored profile and the stored conversation.
