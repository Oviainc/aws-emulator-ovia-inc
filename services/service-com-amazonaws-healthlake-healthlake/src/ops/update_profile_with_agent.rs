//! @op UpdateProfileWithAgent
//!
//! Serves one TURN of the chat-based profile update this operation documents
//! ("Updates a data transformation profile using chat-based interaction with an
//! agent. Supports multi-turn conversations for iteratively customizing profiles"):
//! it resolves the stored data transformation profile, appends the turn to the
//! conversation the request names — minting a `ConversationId` when it names none —
//! and answers with the `AgentOutputMessageStream` event stream the model declares,
//! as a real `vnd.amazon.eventstream` body.
//!
//! ## The loop the model describes
//!
//! `AgentInputMessage.Type` is `normal` or `confirmation_response`, and
//! `EndOfOutputEvent` carries `Options` beside its `FinalResponseMessage` and
//! `ConversationId`. Those members describe one loop, and it is the loop served here:
//!
//! * a `normal` turn reads the profile's DRAFT and asks whether to record the change,
//!   offering the options that answer it ([`crate::state::AGENT_APPLY_OPTION`] and
//!   [`crate::state::AGENT_DISCARD_OPTION`]), which the conversation then remembers;
//! * a `confirmation_response` turn that names the APPLYING option is the turn that
//!   WRITES: it stamps the profile's DRAFT (version
//!   [`crate::state::DRAFT_PROFILE_VERSION`]) with the agent's `ChangeDescription`
//!   and the instant it ran, which `GetDataTransformationProfile` and
//!   `ListDataTransformationProfileVersions` read back;
//! * a `confirmation_response` turn that names the discarding option drops the
//!   proposal and writes nothing;
//! * a `confirmation_response` turn the conversation is not waiting for — nothing
//!   pending for this profile, or a message naming none of the offered options — is
//!   reported IN BAND, as an `ErrorEvent` carrying the modelled
//!   `AgentErrorType` value `ValidationException`: the request and the profile were
//!   both fine, so the stream had already begun.
//!
//! No language model runs in this emulator, so the agent authors no mapping content:
//! every sentence it answers with is composed from the stored profile and the stored
//! conversation ([`crate::state::agent_conversation`]), nothing is echoed back from
//! the caller's `@sensitive` message, and the DRAFT's files are left exactly as they
//! stand — content is stored through `UpdateDataTransformationProfile`, which replaces
//! the DRAFT with content the request carries.
//!
//! ## Why this file is hand-authored
//!
//! The op-stub generator declined this operation because its output member is a
//! `@streaming` event-stream union it cannot frame (`src/ops/SKIPPED_STUBS.md`), and
//! the generated `ErasedOperation` shim of such an operation declines the request too:
//! `serialize_as_event_stream<P>` needs a `Sized` protocol, which the object-safe
//! `run` cannot hand it. So there is no `impl Operation` here and no centralized
//! deserialize -> validate -> handle -> serialize sequence: the framing lives in
//! `service_common::event_stream`, the request half is read through the framework's
//! own deserializer and constraint walk, a violation is refused in this service's own
//! words ([`crate::service::refuse_invalid_input_of`], the same body every other
//! operation's refusal is rendered from), and `src/service.rs` routes a request here
//! through an `EventStreamRoute`.
//!

//! ```
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `ProfileId` (ProfileIdString, len 32..32, pattern ^[a-f0-9]{32}$) **required** —
//!   the profile the turn is about.
//! * `InputMessage` (AgentInputMessage) **required** — `Body` (AgentMessageString, len
//!   1..40960, @sensitive) **required** and `Type` (AgentInputMessageType, one of:
//!   normal | confirmation_response) **required**.
//! * `ConversationId` (ConversationIdString, len 1..36) — the conversation this turn
//!   belongs to; absent on a first turn.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `AgentResponse` (AgentOutputMessageStream, @httpPayload, @streaming)
//!   **required** — the event stream; the response binds no modelled header. The union
//!   carries `TextMessageEvent`, `ProgressEvent`, `HeartbeatEvent`, `ErrorEvent` and
//!   `EndOfOutputEvent`.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `AccessDeniedException` (HTTP 403), `InternalServerException` (HTTP 500),
//!   `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404), `ThrottlingException` (HTTP 429),
//!   `ValidationException` (HTTP 400). Each goes on the wire with the status this
//!   service puts on an error's FAULT (`crate::scaffolded::wire_http_status`), because
//!   awsJson1_0 binds nothing to the transport.
