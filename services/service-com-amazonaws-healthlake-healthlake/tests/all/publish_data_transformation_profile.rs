//! End-to-end behaviour of `PublishDataTransformationProfile` over the real
//! awsJson1_0 wire, read back through `GetDataTransformationProfile`.
//!
//! The rule under test: a publish SNAPSHOTS one version of a profile into a NEW
//! immutable version, numbered one past the profile's latest published version (so
//! the first publish is version 1), carrying exactly the content of the version it
//! was taken from — the DRAFT when the call omits `FromExistingVersion`, the version
//! that member names otherwise — plus that call's own `ChangeDescription`. The
//! version it copied from is left as it was, every version published earlier keeps
//! its own content, and the profile's metadata does not move. A profile or a version
//! no record holds is refused, and so is a profile that has run out of the modelled
//! `ProfileVersion` range or of the bytes this emulator retains for one profile —
//! before anything is written, so a refused publish publishes nothing.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the source format, how many
//! entries the published content has and how large they are, whether the call carries
//! a `ChangeDescription`, how many successive publishes a profile has had, and
//! whether the content being published is the DRAFT or an older published version.
//!
//! Every call below goes through the shared [`Profiles`] harness, i.e.
//! `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` — the same entry point `core/router` serves — so
//! routing, deserialization, the modelled constraints and the error envelope are all
//! exercised, not bypassed.
