//! What instant a job's `EndTime` reports, across every job record this service
//! holds.
//!
//! The rule under test: a timestamp a record reports for a transition the clock
//! owed it is the instant that transition FELL DUE — the instant it happened
//! whether or not anybody called — and never the instant of the call that
//! materialised it. So `ExportJobProperties$EndTime` ("the time the export job
//! completed"), `ImportJobProperties$EndTime` and
//! `TransformationJobProperties$EndTime` each report the due instant of the step
//! that reached the terminal status, whatever the polling delay before some
//! caller first read the record, and two jobs' `EndTime`s therefore order the
//! way the jobs really ended rather than the way they were read.
//!
//! The table below spans that class along the axes the rule generalises over:
//! the job KIND (all three records, so the describe of each reports the same
//! way), the terminal STATUS the clock owes (every terminal value the two
//! modelled status enums declare between them), the SPAN the transition was
//! armed for, and the DELAY between the instant it fell due and the first read —
//! the delay being exactly what a reported read-clock timestamp would drift
//! with. [`a_started_jobs_end_time_is_its_submit_time_plus_its_run_span`] then
//! drives the same rule through the operation that MINTS a record
//! (`StartFHIRExportJob`), where the run span is the service's own
//! `EXPORT_JOB_RUN`, and reads two jobs back in the REVERSE of the order they
//! ended.
//!
//! A started import, export or transformation job is armed with one fixed span,
//! so the rows are
//! seeded straight into the SAME store the handlers read, through the shared
//! engine the harness exposes — exactly how `tests/all/fhir_export_job_describe.rs`
//! and `tests/all/data_transformation_job.rs` seed their rows — which is what
//! lets one row differ from the next in the span and the status its pending
//! transition carries. Every describe itself goes over the real awsJson1_0 wire
//! through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`, so the reported timestamp is the
//! serialized one.
