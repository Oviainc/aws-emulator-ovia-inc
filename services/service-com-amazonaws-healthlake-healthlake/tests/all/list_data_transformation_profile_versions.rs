//! End-to-end behaviour of `ListDataTransformationProfileVersions` over the real
//! awsJson1_0 wire, cross-checked against `GetDataTransformationProfile`.
//!
//! The rule under test: the listing reports EVERY version the named profile
//! holds — its DRAFT (version 0) and each version published from it — in reverse
//! chronological order, newest first, where a version's chronology is WHEN IT WAS
//! CREATED: the DRAFT is minted with the profile and each publish mints the next
//! version number, so the newest version is the highest-numbered one and the
//! DRAFT comes last, however often it is later rewritten. It reports each version
//! through the modelled summary, carrying the profile's own metadata and that
//! version's `ChangeDescription` and `LastUpdatedAt`; and it serves that one order
//! a page at a time, each page holding at most `MaxResults` entries and carrying a
//! `NextToken` exactly when versions remain after it. Because the order is keyed
//! on something no later call rewrites, the pages partition the listing — nothing
//! repeated and nothing skipped — even when the profile is written to between two
//! pages. A profile no record holds is refused, a token that resumes nothing is
//! refused, and the listing writes nothing, so two identical calls answer
//! identically.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the source format, how
//! many versions the profile holds, whether each version carries a
//! `ChangeDescription`, and whether the DRAFT was rewritten after a publish — a
//! rewrite restamps the DRAFT's `LastUpdatedAt` without moving it in the listing,
//! so the reported timestamps and the reported order come apart.
//!
//! Every call below goes through the shared [`Profiles`] harness, i.e.
//! `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` — the same entry point `core/router` serves — so
//! routing, deserialization, the modelled constraints and the error envelope are
//! all exercised, not bypassed.
