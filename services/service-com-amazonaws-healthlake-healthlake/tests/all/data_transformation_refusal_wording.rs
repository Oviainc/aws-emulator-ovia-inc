//! How the data transformation surface WORDS its answers on the awsJson1_0 wire, and
//! what a create and the read after it carry.
//!
//! Four rules, each asserted over a SET of inputs rather than over one recorded
//! request:
//!
//! 1. **A not-found refusal NAMES what the call could not find.** A call that resolves
//!    a profile states `Profile '<ProfileId>' not found`; one that resolves a
//!    particular VERSION of a profile states `Profile '<ProfileId>' version <n> not
//!    found`; a transformation-job read states `Transformation job not found:
//!    <JobId>`. The variable part comes from the request, so two refusals of the same
//!    operation differ exactly where the request did.
//! 2. **A boundary-validation refusal states ONE sentence under BOTH message keys.**
//!    The modelled `ValidationException` declares `Message`
//!    (`smithy_query(query="shape",shape="ValidationException")`) and AWS's validation
//!    framework words the same sentence in the lowercase `message`; both reach the
//!    wire carrying the same text. In it, a `@pattern` clause names the member and the
//!    pattern WITHOUT the `^`/`$` anchors and echoes no value, and an enum clause
//!    names the member and the value set the service reports.
//! 3. **A value that is not an ARN at all is refused by the ARN PARSER**, not by the
//!    member's `@pattern`: `com.amazon.arn.ARNSyntaxException: ARNs must start with
//!    'arn:': <value>`, so no refusal pastes the service's resource-ARN regex into a
//!    response. A value that IS an ARN is resolved against state as before.
//! 4. **A create answers the protocol's 200 with the new profile's status**, and a
//!    read naming no version serves the latest published version — the DRAFT while
//!    there is none — so create -> get and create -> update -> get read back the
//!    content the caller just wrote.
//!
//! Every call goes through [`MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`][d] by way of the shared
//! [`Profiles`] harness — the same entry point `core/router` serves — so routing,
//! deserialization, the modelled constraints and the error envelope are all
//! exercised, not bypassed.
