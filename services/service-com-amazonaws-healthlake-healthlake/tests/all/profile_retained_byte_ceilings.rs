//! WHICH calls charge the BYTES of data transformation profile content this
//! emulator retains.
//!
//! The rule under test: every operation that adds retained profile version content
//! — the mint, the DRAFT rewrite and the publish — charges the ceiling on what ONE
//! profile retains and the ceiling on what EVERY profile retains together, taken
//! over the store as it stands less the bytes the same write gives back, BEFORE it
//! writes anything, and refuses past either with the capacity error it models. So
//! no operation can push the store past a ceiling another operation is then
//! refused for, and a refused call retains nothing.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: WHICH call adds the
//! content (create, update, publish), how many bytes it adds beside how many it
//! releases (more, exactly as many, fewer), and WHICH of the two ceilings the
//! bytes reach.
//!
//! The content the ceilings are charged against is seeded onto the holder records
//! through the shared engine the harness exposes — the way
//! `tests/all/start_data_transformation_job.rs` seeds a profile's published
//! versions — rather than written as tens of megabytes of create bodies; every
//! seeded version holds at most the bytes one mapping may carry, so no holder is a
//! record an operation could not have written. The CHARGED call itself always goes
//! over the real awsJson1_0 wire through
//! [`MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`](smithy_server_runtime::MultiServiceRouter), and
//! so does every read-back.
//!
//! Every modelled CLIENT error is asserted at HTTP 400 whatever status its shape's
//! `@httpError` names, for the reason `tests/all/error_envelopes.rs` pins: awsJson
//! binds nothing to the transport, so this service reports an error's FAULT.
