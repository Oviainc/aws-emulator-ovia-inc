//! End-to-end behaviour of `ListDataTransformationProfiles` over the real
//! awsJson1_0 wire, cross-checked against `GetDataTransformationProfile`.
//!
//! The rule under test: the listing reports every data transformation profile the
//! service holds whose source data format is the one the request names — ONCE
//! each, never one entry per version — through the modelled summary carrying that
//! profile's latest version number, its metadata, and the instant the profile
//! itself last changed; and it serves one stable order a page at a time, each page
//! holding at most `MaxResults` entries and carrying a `NextToken` exactly when
//! profiles remain after it. A profile of another source format is not in the
//! listing, a deleted profile leaves it, a bad request is refused, and the listing
//! writes nothing, so two identical calls answer identically.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the source format, how
//! many profiles there are of each, how many versions a profile holds (from a
//! DRAFT that was never published to several published versions), whether the
//! profile carries a `ProfileDescription`, and WHICH version was written last — a
//! DRAFT rewritten after a publish leaves the latest version number behind the
//! profile's own last-updated instant, so the two come apart.
//!
//! Every call below goes through the shared [`Profiles`] harness, i.e.
//! `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` — the same entry point `core/router` serves — so
//! routing, deserialization, the modelled constraints and the error envelope are
//! all exercised, not bypassed.
