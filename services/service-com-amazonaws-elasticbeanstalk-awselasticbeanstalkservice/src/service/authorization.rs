//! Whether IAM lets a request to this service perform the action it asks for — the
//! authorization step an operation takes BEFORE it reads or writes anything.
//!
//! AWS decides authorization at the IAM layer, ahead of the service looking at the
//! resource, so a caller whose policies do not permit the action is told it is not
//! authorized and the call performs nothing: no resource is created, no status moves and
//! no quota is consumed. The answer is `AccessDenied` with HTTP 403, the refusal AWS
//! states for a call its identity-based policies do not allow.
//!
//! Three pieces, each held in exactly one place:
//!
//! 1. **who** — the principal the request's access key id speaks for, read from the IAM
//!    store of the same shared engine, which holds both halves of that question: the
//!    role-session record a temporary credential's mint left there, and the registry
//!    `iam:CreateAccessKey` wrote for a long-term key. So the principal a refusal blames
//!    is the one the account really holds for the credential the request signed with.
//! 2. **what it may do** — the identity-based policy documents the IAM store holds for
//!    that principal and the permissions boundary that caps them, read through IAM's own
//!    accessors (`principal_policies`, `permissions_boundary_document`), where the
//!    collection rule itself lives — so a policy `iam:PutRolePolicy` wrote takes effect on
//!    the next request and deleting it lifts it again.
//! 3. **the decision** — [`::service_common::iam_authorization`], the tree's ONE
//!    evaluation of those documents against `(action, resource)`, so this service and
//!    every other one handed the same documents answer alike: an explicit `Deny` wins,
//!    otherwise an `Allow` about the request grants it, and with neither the request falls
//!    to IAM's default deny.
//!
//! Only the store LOOKUPS live here; the decision does not. That is the same split every
//! other gate in this tree makes, and the lookups stay in the service crate for the reason
//! those keep theirs there: hoisting them into `service-common` would make every service
//! that depends on that crate link the IAM service crate.
//!
//! ## The callers this gate does not bound
//!
//! * **The account's own published credential.** A request whose access key id the IAM
//!   store holds no record for speaks for the account itself — the position AWS account
//!   root credentials are in — which holds no identity-based policies, so such a request
//!   is allowed. An emulated AWS service calling this one through the in-process callback
//!   signs with that credential.
//! * **A principal holding an attachment this emulator cannot read.** An AWS-managed
//!   policy belongs to AWS rather than to this account, so the account's store holds no
//!   document for it; refusing on a grant this emulator cannot see would deny access AWS
//!   permits. An explicit `Deny` in a document that CAN be read still refuses, and a
//!   permissions boundary the store DOES hold still caps the grant.
//! * **An engine carrying no IAM store**, where no role and no policy can exist.
