//! `DeleteApplicationVersion`, driven end to end over the service's awsQuery HTTP
//! surface.
//!
//! The rule under test: deleting an application version removes exactly the
//! `(ApplicationName, VersionLabel)` record the request names and nothing else,
//! succeeds whatever the label and whether or not that record was there, is
//! refused with the operation's modelled `OperationInProgressException` while an
//! environment of that application that has not reached `Terminated` is deployed
//! from the version, and is refused with `InvalidParameterValue` when the
//! application name resolves to nothing. `DeleteSourceBundle` changes none of it:
//! the flag speaks about an S3 object, and the version record goes either way.
//!
//! The emulator and the XML reader come from [`crate::lifecycle`], so this suite
//! speaks to the service over the same router and in the same dialect the rest of
//! the crate's tests do.
