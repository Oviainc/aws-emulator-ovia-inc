//! `DeletePlatformVersion`, driven end to end over this service's awsQuery HTTP
//! surface with the shared harness in `crate::harness`.
//!
//! The rule under test: the operation deletes a CUSTOM platform version this
//! account created and nothing else. It resolves the `PlatformArn` against the
//! account's own versions; an ARN naming a version the account does not own —
//! every version Elastic Beanstalk publishes itself — is refused as an ownership
//! failure, one naming no version at all as missing, one whose version has an
//! operation still running as an operation in progress, and one still carrying a
//! running environment as a reference that has to go first. Nothing is deleted by
//! any of those refusals. A delete that IS accepted starts an asynchronous
//! deletion: the version reports the non-terminal `Deleting` status the call
//! answers with, and the record stops being held once the clock has carried the
//! deletion out — after which the same name and version can be created again.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: the name and version of the
//! platform (plain, dotted, several versions of one platform), the Region the
//! create was signed for and the ARN then carries, the published catalogue entry a
//! managed ARN names (the first, the last and a superseded release of a branch),
//! the form an unresolvable ARN arrives in, and the state the version is in when
//! the delete arrives (building, ready, already deleting, launched into a running
//! environment, launched into a terminated one).
//!
//! The refusal templates are written out HERE rather than imported from the
//! service, so a change to the service's wording fails these tests instead of
//! moving with them.
