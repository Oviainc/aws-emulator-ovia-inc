//! Configuration RESOLUTION: what a read of a configuration set reports, driven
//! end to end over this service's awsQuery surface.
//!
//! RULE under test: a configuration set reports the RESOLVED option settings of
//! the platform version it is for — every option that version's published
//! catalogue gives a `DefaultValue` for, at that default, with the settings the
//! configuration itself holds replacing the defaults of the options they name
//! and adding the options the catalogue does not define. So the set a read
//! answers with carries options the caller never wrote, an option the catalogue
//! gives no default for is reported only where the configuration sets it, and an
//! option an `OptionsToRemove` takes out stops overriding its default and
//! resolves back to it instead of vanishing from the set.
//!
//! The defaults every assertion here is made against are read over the WIRE from
//! `DescribeConfigurationOptions` — the operation that owns the catalogue — so
//! nothing below restates a default value, and a configuration set resolved
//! against a different catalogue than the one that operation publishes fails
//! these tests.
//!
//! Each table row is a different point in that class: which platform version the
//! set is for (its runtime adds options of its own), whether the set is a saved
//! template or a running environment's configuration, how many settings it
//! holds, whether a setting overrides an option the catalogue defines or names
//! one it does not, whether it carries a `ResourceName`, and which kind of
//! option a removal names.
//!
//! The HTTP harness (`Emulator`, `Answer`) is the one `all/lifecycle.rs` owns and
//! the option encoders and readers are `all/configuration_templates.rs`'s, so no
//! second copy of either can drift. Nothing here reaches into the store.
