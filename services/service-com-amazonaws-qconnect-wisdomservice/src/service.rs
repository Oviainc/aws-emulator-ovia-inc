//! The `com-amazonaws-qconnect-wisdomservice` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. Return `Some(op)` to route one yourself.
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## The content-upload plane
//!
//! `StartContentUpload` hands out a URL, and a URL is a promise that it can be
//! FOLLOWED. The URL it mints (`crate::state::content_upload_url`) addresses the
//! endpoint the caller reached, under the upload's own path
//! (`/knowledgeBases/<knowledgeBaseId>/uploads/<uploadId>`) — a path the model binds no
//! operation to, so it reaches this file twice:
//!
//! - [`Service::can_handle`] claims a request to an upload path naming an upload THIS
//!   store holds, so following the URL routes back here even when nothing else in the
//!   request names a service (an upload URL is followed WITHOUT a signature, as a
//!   presigned URL is, and a loopback endpoint host names no service at all).
//! - [`Service::override_routing_error`] serves it: that seam is reached BEFORE
//!   authentication precisely for requests that name no modelled operation, which is
//!   what makes an unsigned `PUT` to a minted URL work.
//!
//! The plane writes ONLY the upload the URL names — the bytes, bounded both per body
//! (`crate::state::MAX_CONTENT_UPLOAD_BYTES`) and across every written body this store
//! holds (`crate::state::MAX_PENDING_UPLOAD_BYTES`) — and refuses a `PUT` that is late
//! (the URL's `urlExpiry` has passed) or that does not carry the headers the start call
//! published. Nothing else about the service is reachable through it. The legacy Amazon
//! Connect Wisdom view of this same endpoint serves its own uploads the same way, out of
//! its own store.
