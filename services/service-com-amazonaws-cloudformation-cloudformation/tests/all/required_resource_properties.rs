//! The PRE-DEPLOYMENT validation a stack operation's resources are held to against what
//! their type REQUIRES, end to end over the awsQuery wire.
//!
//! RULE: CloudFormation validates each declared resource against its resource type's schema
//! before provisioning anything, so a declaration that does not carry a property that schema
//! marks required fails the operation before any resource is created: the stack records a
//! `PROPERTY_VALIDATION` validation result — `FAILED`, handled by failing, reading
//! `Required property [<member>] not found` at the resource's own
//! `/Resources/<logical id>/Properties` — and rolls back to `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` with nothing
//! provisioned. A declaration that carries every required property is deployed as written.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: WHICH resource type the declaration
//! is of (five services), WHICH of that type's required properties is the missing one (the
//! first, a later one, every one of them at once), and the form the declaration takes (a
//! property document missing one member, and no `Properties` member at all). The catalogue
//! the stage judges against is `state::property_validation::REQUIRED_PROPERTIES`, whose rows
//! are each type's "Required: Yes" properties, and the row for `AWS::EC2::Subnet` is one the
//! report that led here did not cite.
