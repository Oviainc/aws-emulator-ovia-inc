//! What a SUBMITTED template is held to BEFORE the operation it was submitted to acts on
//! it: the template-validation rules CloudFormation applies synchronously, and the
//! `ValidationError` each one answers.
//!
//! CloudFormation "validates the template" as part of accepting a stack operation, and a
//! template whose own declarations cannot be resolved is one it never deploys: the call is
//! refused with HTTP 400 and NOTHING is written, rather than accepted with a stack id and
//! then deployed into a stack whose resources carry nulls. [`refusal`] is that whole pass,
//! in ONE place, so every operation that TAKES a body holds it to the same rules and words
//! the refusal the same way: the three that submit one for deployment — `CreateStack`,
//! `UpdateStack`, `CreateChangeSet` — and `ValidateTemplate`, whose whole answer IS a
//! verdict on the body, over the values the template's own `Default`s put in force.
//!
//! Every rule here is decided from the template DOCUMENT alone, which is what makes it a
//! rule about the request rather than about the deployment:
//!
//! * a body the reader will not read at all is a template-FORM error
//!   ([`super::template::not_well_formed`]);
//! * the `AWS::LanguageExtensions` directives are functions only that transform defines, so
//!   a template using one without declaring it is refused — and `Fn::ForEach` is refused in
//!   a section the transform does not define it for;
//! * an intrinsic function whose arguments are not the ones it takes is refused for its own
//!   arity, as is a condition's boolean operator;
//! * a `Ref` naming something the template does not declare, and a `Condition` naming a
//!   condition it does not declare, are unresolved DEPENDENCIES: the section they appear in
//!   is named, because that is where the author has to look — while an `Fn::GetAtt` reading
//!   an attribute off a resource the template does not declare is reported for the FUNCTION
//!   instance that read it, as is an `Fn::Sub` whose dotted `${Name.Attribute}` reference
//!   names no resource attribute at all ([`substitution_attribute_refusal`], which the
//!   operations that only SUMMARISE a template are held to as well);
//! * an `Fn::FindInMap` whose keys the `Mappings` section does not carry resolves to
//!   nothing — unless the lookup names a `DefaultValue` to fall back to;
//! * and a dependency CYCLE among the declared resources is refused, since no creation
//!   order satisfies it.
//!
//! The semantic rules are applied to the template's PROCESSED stage — the document
//! CloudFormation really deploys — so a resource a transform's expansion contributes is
//! held to them, and a loop's own identifier is not read as an undeclared name. A template
//! whose processed stage this service cannot compute is left to the stack's own failure
//! ([`super::template::process`]), which is the one thing this pass has nothing to say
//! about.
//!
//! The `Rules` section is NOT part of this pass: a rule's assertion is checked against the
//! parameter values a deployment runs with, and a failing one fails that deployment rather
//! than the request that submitted it — [`rules_failure`].
