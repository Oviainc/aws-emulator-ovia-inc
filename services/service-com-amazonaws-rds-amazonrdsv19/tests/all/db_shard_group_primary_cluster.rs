//! End-to-end tests for the PRIMARY DB CLUSTER a `CreateDBShardGroup` names: how the
//! create resolves it, and which of that cluster's states the create can act on.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire through `db_instances::emulator`, the one mounting helper
//! this test target has, as a real awsQuery form POST carrying the SigV4 credential scope
//! the router keys on — so a handler that computed nothing could not pass these
//! assertions.
//!
//! The rule under test: `DBClusterIdentifier` is "the name of the primary DB cluster for
//! the DB shard group", resolved in the region the request is signed for in either form
//! that member accepts and without regard to case, and a create is served for a cluster in
//! any state it can act on — a provisioning status included — while a cluster whose delete
//! has begun is the modelled state fault and a cluster the delete has already taken out is
//! the modelled cluster not-found, neither of which leaves a DB shard group behind.
//!
//! The table below spans what the rule generalises over: the state the cluster is in when
//! the create arrives (still provisioning, settled, its delete running, and gone), and each
//! form the create may name it by (its own spelling, another case, and its ARN).
