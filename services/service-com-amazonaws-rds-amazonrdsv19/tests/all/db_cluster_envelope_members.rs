//! End-to-end tests for the `DBCluster` ENVELOPE every operation of this front door that
//! reports a cluster answers with, and for what an accepted `DeleteDBCluster` answers.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire through `db_instances::emulator`, the one mounting helper
//! this test target has, as a real awsQuery form POST carrying the SigV4 credential scope
//! the router keys on, so each assertion reads the XML the emulator itself produced.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! * ONE serializer, ONE envelope: whichever operation reports a cluster — the create that
//!   minted it, the read, the modification and the delete — reports the same members for it.
//!   The members this suite pins are the ones the API reports for EVERY cluster it holds,
//!   independent of engine: the two express-configuration settings, the two capability
//!   flags, the database-activity-stream status under both names the envelope carries it
//!   under, the Route 53 hosted zone its endpoints sit in, the DB subnet group it is placed
//!   in and the VPC security groups it belongs to.
//! * A member a cluster's CONFIGURATION decides is reported for a cluster that has it and
//!   left out for one that does not: the Aurora Serverless v2 platform version is reported
//!   for a cluster with Serverless v2 capacity, and the KMS key identifier for a cluster
//!   whose storage is encrypted — the key the request named, or the account's default key
//!   for this service where it named none.
//! * A create that names no `EngineVersion` provisions the ENGINE's default version, and the
//!   default DB cluster parameter group it reports is the one of THAT version's family. Both
//!   are read out of `DescribeDBEngineVersions`, so the catalogue this service publishes and
//!   the cluster it creates cannot disagree.
//! * An accepted delete answers the cluster AS IT FOUND IT and moves it on: a delete that
//!   skips the final snapshot answers the status the cluster carried, a delete that asks for
//!   a final DB cluster snapshot takes that snapshot and answers the cluster `backing-up`,
//!   and either way the cluster reaches `deleting` and then leaves the service. A
//!   modification answers the same way.
//!
//! Each rule is asserted over a TABLE spanning what it generalises over: the cluster TYPES
//! `CreateDBCluster` documents (Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters), four engines
//! across the three control planes this front door serves, a request that names nothing
//! beyond the two required members and requests that name a subnet group, security groups,
//! Serverless v2 capacity and storage encryption, and both regions whose published hosted
//! zone id this service carries.
