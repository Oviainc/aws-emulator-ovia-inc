//! End-to-end tests for the SENTENCE each not-found refusal of the Aurora Limitless shard
//! group, snapshot-export and blue/green families carries.
//!
//! The rule under test: a not-found refusal answers the sentence Amazon RDS words for that
//! operation's fault — its fixed text exactly, and only the variable parts the service puts
//! in it, taken from the request — rather than one house-style template built from the
//! resource type and the identifier the request carried. Concretely, over the operations
//! whose recorded refusals this suite spans:
//!
//! * `ModifyDBShardGroup` answers `DBShardGroupNotFound` (404, the `awsQueryError` code of
//!   `DBShardGroupNotFoundFault` —
//!   `smithy_query(query="operation", operation="ModifyDBShardGroup,DeleteDBShardGroup,
//!   RebootDBShardGroup")`) with one FIXED sentence about the identifier-and-account pair,
//!   while `DeleteDBShardGroup` and `RebootDBShardGroup` answer the same fault with the
//!   FIXED sentence about a shard group that cannot be reached. Neither carries the
//!   identifier.
//! * `CreateDBShardGroup` answers `DBClusterNotFoundFault` (404) for a primary cluster it
//!   cannot resolve with one FIXED sentence that names no cluster.
//! * `CancelExportTask` answers `ExportTaskNotFound` (404) with a sentence that NAMES the
//!   `ExportTaskIdentifier` the request carried, unquoted, in the spelling it was sent in.
//! * `DeleteBlueGreenDeployment` and `DescribeBlueGreenDeployments` answer
//!   `BlueGreenDeploymentNotFoundFault` (404) with a sentence that names the deployment
//!   identifier the request carried, SINGLE-QUOTED.
//!
//! Each table spans what the rule generalises over: the shape of an identifier nothing
//! holds (a fresh name, a near miss of a stored one, a single letter, mixed case, a name at
//! the published length bound), how it came to hold nothing (never created, created and
//! then deleted, held only by another region), and — for the sentences with a variable part
//! — a value the test never spells out, taken from what the service minted.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire through the harness in `db_instances.rs`, so each
//! assertion reads the XML the emulator itself answered with.
