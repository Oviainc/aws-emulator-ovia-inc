//! End-to-end tests for the DB security group DELETE path: `DeleteDBSecurityGroup` against
//! what `CreateDBSecurityGroup` persisted, and against what this service no longer holds.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire, through the same mounting helper and awsQuery form POST
//! the sibling suites use, so the assertions read the XML the emulator itself answered
//! with and a handler that computed nothing could not pass them.
//!
//! The rule under test is the one `db_subnet_group_deletion.rs` and
//! `option_group_deletion.rs` pin for their own resources, one resource type along: a
//! delete of a named group removes the record its create persisted from the region the
//! request was signed for, so every later read of that name — the report, a second delete,
//! a tag read on its ARN, the account's quota report — sees it gone; the modelled not-found
//! fault is answered only for a name that region holds no group for; and the one documented
//! refusal in between is a group still associated with a DB instance ("The specified DB
//! security group must not be associated with any DB instances"), which is the state fault
//! rather than the not-found. The not-found is worded by the ROLE the group plays in the
//! call — the delete acts on the group, the report looks it up — so both wordings of the one
//! fault are asserted here.
//!
//! The tables span the classes the rule generalises over: the case and the length of the
//! name, the description, how many tags the create carried, how many ingress rules the
//! group holds (none, because this API version cannot authorize one), the spelling the
//! delete names the group in, the spelling the DB instance recorded its membership in, and
//! the region the group was created in.
