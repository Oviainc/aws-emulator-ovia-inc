//! End-to-end tests for `RebootDBShardGroup`: the restart it accepts for a stored Aurora
//! Limitless Database DB shard group, and the requests it refuses.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire through `db_instances::emulator`, the one mounting helper
//! this test target has, as a real awsQuery form POST carrying the SigV4 credential scope
//! the router keys on. The assertions read the XML the emulator answers with and then read
//! the same shard group back through `DescribeDBShardGroups`, so a handler that answered
//! without persisting the restart could not pass them.
//!
//! The rule under test: a reboot accepted for the stored DB shard group the request names in
//! the region it is signed for puts that shard group into the transient `rebooting` status,
//! leaves every other member exactly as it stood — a restart carries no new settings — and
//! owes it the `available` status again once the momentary outage is over, which every read
//! of that identifier reports in the meantime; a shard group that is not in the available
//! state is the modelled state fault and a name the region holds no shard group of is the
//! modelled not-found fault, neither of which changes anything.
//!
//! The tables below span what that rule generalises over: shard groups differing in capacity
//! range (named with and without a minimum, whole and fractional), in every published
//! `ComputeRedundancy` value, in both settings of `PubliclyAccessible`, in how many tags they
//! carry and in the length and case of their identifier; the spelling the reboot names them
//! by; repeated reboots of one shard group; every state a reboot is answered in (still being
//! created, already rebooting, being deleted, gone); the regional scope; and the shapes the
//! identifier's own constraints refuse.
