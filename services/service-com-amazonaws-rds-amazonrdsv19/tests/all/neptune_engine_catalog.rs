//! End-to-end tests for the GRAPH engine's half of the two published engine reports this
//! front door answers.
//!
//! This one front door serves three control planes (`src/service.rs`): Amazon RDS, Amazon
//! DocumentDB and Amazon Neptune all publish the same wire identity, so a Neptune client
//! signs `rds` and its catalog reads land here. The rule these tables pin is therefore the
//! same rule the RDS engines already obey, applied to the engine of a control plane this
//! door serves on behalf of another API:
//!
//! * `DescribeDBEngineVersions` publishes that engine's OWN release line — every
//!   maintained minor family, each family's releases in ascending order, each row carrying
//!   that family's DB parameter group family, that engine's product name in its version
//!   description, and an upgrade chain onto its later versions;
//! * `DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions` offers an option for every version that report
//!   calls available, under that engine's OWN licence model and storage type.
//!
//! The rows span the engine's major-version families, which is what the rule generalises
//! over: the family name form changes across them (`neptune1` for the first,
//! `neptune<major>` from the second on), the per-version capability changes across them
//! (a global database is offered from the second family on), and each family carries a
//! different number of releases.
//!
//! The harness (`emulator`, `call`, `expect_ok` and the element readers) is the
//! [`crate::db_instances`] suite's, reused rather than copied.
