//! The IAM roles associated with a DB instance or a DB cluster: the rules
//! `AddRoleToDBInstance`, `AddRoleToDBCluster`, `RemoveRoleFromDBInstance` and
//! `RemoveRoleFromDBCluster` share.
//!
//! An association is what lets a database engine act under a caller-supplied role for ONE
//! feature of that engine — loading from and unloading to Amazon S3, invoking a Lambda
//! function, calling an Aurora machine-learning service — so the four operations all answer
//! the same questions before they write: is the value an IAM role ARN at all
//! ([`is_iam_role_arn`]), does it name a role this account's IAM holds that
//! `rds.amazonaws.com` may assume, and is the `FeatureName` one the addressed resource's
//! ENGINE VERSION publishes. Each question has one answer per request whichever resource
//! the request addressed, so they are stated once here rather than twice in the instance
//! and cluster handlers.
//!
//! What an association already in place is refused for is the one thing that differs by
//! resource, because Amazon RDS words and codes the two refusals differently: a DB
//! INSTANCE's engine takes one role ARN per feature name, and a DB CLUSTER takes one
//! association per role.
//!
//! The feature names are not a list of this module's own: they are the
//! `DBEngineVersion$SupportedFeatureNames` this service already publishes for that engine
//! version (`FeatureName` documents them as "the feature for the DB instance that the IAM
//! role is to be associated with. For information about supported feature names, see
//! DBEngineVersion"), read from the one catalogue
//! [`crate::ops::describe_db_engine_versions`] reports them from, so a client that read the
//! list and a request that names one of its entries cannot disagree.
