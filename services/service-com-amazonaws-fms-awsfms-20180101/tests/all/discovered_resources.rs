//! End-to-end cover for `ListDiscoveredResources` — the organisation's inventory
//! of "resources in the organization's accounts that are available to be
//! associated with a resource set".
//!
//! RULE under test: for one member account and one resource type, Firewall
//! Manager reports exactly the resources the service that OWNS that type holds
//! for that account in the Region the request addresses — each as the ARN it
//! would be associated by, its type, its owning account and its name — in
//! bounded pages; it keeps no inventory of its own, so a resource created
//! through the owning service's API is discoverable with no propagation step and
//! one deleted there stops being discovered, and a type no emulated service owns
//! and a MEMBER account that owns nothing both report an EMPTY list, while an
//! account the organisation does not hold is refused outright
//! ([`the_member_account_must_be_one_of_the_organizations_accounts`]).
//!
//! LIMIT of the Region half of that rule, asserted as such in
//! [`a_resource_whose_service_records_no_region_is_discovered_from_every_region`]:
//! a resource is attributed to the Region its owning service RECORDED, so a
//! service whose records keep neither an ARN nor a Region (EC2's VPC, instance,
//! network-interface and address stores) has none to attribute, and its
//! resources are reported from every Region under an ARN naming the Region that
//! asked — the same answer that service's own Region-agnostic describes give.
//! Narrowing that needs those records to carry a Region, which is EC2's to
//! change, not Firewall Manager's.
//!
//! The table in [`discovers_what_the_owning_services_hold`] is the class that
//! rule ranges over: one row per resource type, the rows differing in the OWNING
//! SERVICE (Amazon EC2, Network Firewall, Elastic Load Balancing v2, API
//! Gateway), in the protocol the resource was created over (an `ec2Query` form
//! POST, an awsJson1_0 POST, an awsQuery form POST, a `restJson1` POST), in the
//! shape of the resource's ARN (including API Gateway's, whose account field is
//! EMPTY), in whether the name is an id or a caller-chosen name, and in count.
//! The resource types come from the catalogue
//! [`state::DISCOVERABLE_RESOURCE_TYPES`], itself sourced from the types
//! `Policy$ResourceType` documents. The two catalogue entries no row creates a
//! resource for — CloudFront's distribution and the Classic load balancer — are
//! asserted only on the EMPTY inventory their mounted-but-empty store answers
//! with, in [`an_inventory_with_nothing_in_it_is_empty`].
//!
//! Every call here goes over the wire through one `MultiServiceRouter` with
//! Firewall Manager AND every owning service mounted on ONE shared engine — the
//! way the emulator's own router assembles them, which is what makes the
//! cross-service read under test real.
