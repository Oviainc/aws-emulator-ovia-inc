//! request signatures in the framework, before any handler runs.
//!
//! `AccessDeniedException` is still reachable, for the one condition that does not

//! report a reference to a scope or a monitor the store does not hold as an absence,
//! and a reference it cannot resolve it also cannot authorize, so that is the
