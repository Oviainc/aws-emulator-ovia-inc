//! `UpdateScraper`, end to end over HTTP: an update replaces exactly the members the
//! request CARRIES, leaves every member it omits as the store had it, moves the record to
//! `UPDATING` — the status it reports — and lets the clock settle it back to `ACTIVE`.
//!
//! Every assertion reads the scraper back through `DescribeScraper`, so what is checked is
//! what the service PERSISTED rather than what the request carried.
//!
//! The store is seeded directly here, through the same engine the mounted service reads
//! ([`crate::scraper_listing::seed`]): seeding is how a scraper of an EXACT stored shape —
//! a chosen id, status, source and destination — exists to update, and it is the same
//! record the handlers read, not a second copy of it. `CreateScraper` itself is driven in
//! `crate::scraper_creation`.
