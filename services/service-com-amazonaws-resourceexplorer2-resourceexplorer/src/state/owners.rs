//! The owning services whose resources a Region's index holds.
//!
//! An index is a VIEW over resources this service does not own: a `Resource` is one
//! "that Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer has discovered, and for which it has
//! stored information in the index of the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the
//! resource" (the shape's own documentation), and `Resource$Service` is "the Amazon Web
//! Services service that owns the resource and is responsible for creating and updating
//! it". So every row here is read from the OWNING service's own records at query time
//! and nothing is copied into this service's store: a resource created through that
//! service's API is in the index with no Resource Explorer call in between, one deleted
//! there leaves the index, and a tag written there is the tag a `tag:` filter matches.
//!
//! # What "linked" means
//!
//! One emulator process holds every service's state in one engine, but a crate can only
//! read a state struct it names, so this module lists the owning services this crate
//! depends on; a resource of any other service is not indexed, which is this emulator's
//! boundary rather than an AWS rule (AWS indexes the types its "Supported resource
//! types" list names). Adding a service here is a dependency in `Cargo.toml`, an
//! [`OwnedType`] per resource type it owns and one block of [`indexed_resources`].
