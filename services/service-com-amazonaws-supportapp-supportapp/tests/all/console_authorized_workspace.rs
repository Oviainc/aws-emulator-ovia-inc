//! End-to-end tests for the Slack workspace `RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization` acts
//! on having to EXIST first.
//!
//! The rule under test: an operation that acts on the resource its request identifies
//! settles that resource's existence in this account's state before any precondition on
//! the CALLING ACCOUNT, and answers a miss with the modelled `ResourceNotFoundException`
//! (HTTP 404) — "The specified resource is missing or doesn't exist, such as an account
//! alias, Slack channel configuration, or Slack workspace configuration"
//! (`smithy_query(query="operation",operation="RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization",
//! model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-supportapp-supportapp/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-supportapp-supportapp.json")`).
//! For this operation the resource is the Slack workspace itself: one reaches this API
//! only through the interactive flow in the Amazon Web Services Support Center console —
//! "Sign in to the Amazon Web Services Support Center and authorize the Slack workspaces
//! where you want your organization to have access to", after which the API
//! "authorize[s] each Slack workspace for the organization"
//! (`smithy_query(query="doc",shape="RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization")`) — so a
//! `teamId` no console authorization recorded is that 404, never the `ConflictException`
//! (409) of an account topology, and nothing is registered.
//!
//! So the tables below run the rule over what it generalises over, with the recorded
//! `T<10 uppercase hex>` case as a single row:
//!
//! * the `teamId` form and length, at both published `len 1..256` bounds;
//! * the ACCOUNT TOPOLOGY the lookup happens in — the default account, which belongs to
//!   no organization, an organization the caller manages, and one another account manages
//!   — because the resource miss is settled ahead of every one of them;
//! * what the account holds BESIDES the named workspace: nothing, or other workspaces
//!   authorized and registered;
//! * how many times the call is repeated, since a refusal is not a state transition.
//!
//! The served side of the rule is here too: the workspace the API's own documentation
//! names (the one entry of
//! `service_com_amazonaws_supportapp_supportapp::state::CONSOLE_AUTHORIZED_SLACK_WORKSPACES`,
//! which the issue did not cite) registers over the wire with nothing arranged beyond the
//! organization, and a console authorization outlives the registration it let through, so
//! a deleted workspace configuration can be registered again.
//!
//! Every assertion goes over the wire through the same router the production emulator
//! mounts, reusing the harness in [`crate::slack_channel_configurations`]; the only thing
//! not driven over the wire is the console authorization itself, which is not an API call
//! (see `Emulator::authorize_workspace_in_console`), and every row reads its effect back
//! through `ListSlackWorkspaceConfigurations`.
