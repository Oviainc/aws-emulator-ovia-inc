//! @op RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization
//!
//! Registers a Slack workspace with this account, recording it in the account's
//! workspace registry (`state::slack_workspace_configurations`) and reporting the
//! stored record. That registry is the precondition
//! `CreateSlackChannelConfiguration` enforces: until a workspace is registered, a
//! channel configuration in it is a `ConflictException`.
//!
//! The call acts on a workspace that ALREADY exists for this API, so the workspace the
//! request identifies is looked up before any precondition on the calling account, the
//! same order the operations that act on a stored Slack channel configuration follow: a
//! Slack workspace reaches this API only through the interactive flow in the Amazon Web
//! Services Support Center console — "Sign in to the Amazon Web Services Support Center
//! and authorize the Slack workspaces where you want your organization to have access
//! to", after which this API "authorize[s] each Slack workspace for the organization" —
//! and no operation of this API performs that flow, so the authorizations it left are
//! state no call writes ([`crate::state::CONSOLE_AUTHORIZED_SLACK_WORKSPACES`]). A
//! `teamId` absent from them names no workspace this call can act on and is the modelled
//! `ResourceNotFoundException`
//! ([`crate::state::ComAmazonawsSupportappSupportappState::unauthorized_workspace_not_found`]);
//! nothing is registered.
//!
//! This is also an Organizations-scoped call — "To call this API, your account must be part
//! of an organization in Organizations" — so the account's membership is settled next,
//! before the registry is written, by reading the Organizations control plane's own store
//! through the shared engine ([`crate::state::caller_account_type`]): an account that
//! belongs to no organization is the first condition this operation's
//! `ConflictException` enumerates, so the call is refused with it and nothing is
//! registered. When an organization does hold the account, `accountType` reports the
//! role that organization's own record gives it — `management` for the account that
//! manages it, `member` for one of its other member accounts. The documented workspace
//! quota bounds the registry past that — see
//! [`crate::state::MAX_SLACK_WORKSPACE_CONFIGURATIONS`].
//!
//! The role the organization gives the account GOVERNS the call, it is not only reported:
//! a workspace is authorized for an organization in two steps — "After the management
//! account authorizes the Slack workspace, member accounts can call this API to authorize
//! the same Slack workspace for their individual accounts" — so a call from an account
//! that is only a member of its organization is served for a workspace the registry
//! already holds and refused, with the second condition this operation's
//! `ConflictException` enumerates, for one it does not. The refusal registers nothing.
//!
//! `teamName` is the name the Slack workspace carries in Slack. A registered workspace
//! has one, and this operation and `ListSlackWorkspaceConfigurations` both report it, so
//! the registration RECORDS a name for the workspace — derived from the workspace's own
//! identifier by [`crate::state::derived_slack_workspace_name`], because the emulator has
//! no Slack directory to ask and no request member carries it — and every later report of
//! that workspace reads back the stored value. The stored record's
//! `allowOrganizationMemberAccount` is what "lets member accounts authorize Slack
//! workspaces", which is what a registration FROM THE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT grants, so only
//! that call records it — on a workspace the account already held as much as on one it did
//! not — and a member account's call leaves it as the management account's registration
//! left it. That field is what `ListSlackWorkspaceConfigurations` reports.
//!
//! ## Shape of an operation
//!
//! Each operation is a struct that owns the shared engine and implements
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::Operation`]. The framework constructs one per service via
//! `RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization::new(engine)` and drives it through the centralized request walk:
//! deserialize → validate → `handle` → serialize. You write ONLY the `handle` body.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the guard it hands back:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!     let state = crate::state::service_state(&*self.engine)
//!         .ok_or(/* a modelled server error */)?;
//!     state.lock().your_field = /* ... */;
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//! The engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! @generated by the emulator core scaffold op-stub generator.
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!

//!
//! # Modeled contract for `RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-supportapp-supportapp/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-supportapp-supportapp.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Registers a Slack workspace for your Amazon Web Services account. To call this API, your
//! account must be part of an organization in Organizations. If you're the management
//! account and you want to register Slack workspaces for your organization, you must
//! complete the following tasks: Sign in to the Amazon Web Services Support Center and
//! authorize the Slack workspaces where you want your organization to have access to. See
//! Authorize a Slack workspace in the Amazon Web Services Support User Guide. Call the
//! RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization API to authorize each Slack workspace for the
//! organization. After the management account authorizes the Slack workspace, member
//! accounts can call this API to authorize the same Slack workspace for their individual
//! accounts. Member accounts don't need to authorize the Slack workspace manually through
//! the Amazon Web Services Support Center. To use the Amazon Web Services Support App, each
//! account must then complete the following tasks: Create an Identity and Access Management
//! (IAM) role with the required permission. For more information, see Managing access to
//! the Amazon Web Services Support App. Configure a Slack channel to use the Amazon Web
//! Services Support App for support cases for that account. For more information, see
//! Configuring a Slack channel.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `teamId` (teamId, len 1..256, pattern ^\S+$) **required** — The team ID in Slack. This
//!   ID uniquely identifies a Slack workspace, such as T012ABCDEFG. Specify the Slack
//!   workspace that you want to use for your organization.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `accountType` (AccountType, one of: management | member) — Whether the Amazon Web
//!   Services account is a management or member account that's part of an organization in
//!   Organizations.
//! * `teamId` (teamId, len 1..256, pattern ^\S+$) — The team ID in Slack. This ID uniquely
//!   identifies a Slack workspace, such as T012ABCDEFG.
//! * `teamName` (teamName, len 1..256, pattern ^.+$) — The name of the Slack workspace.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `AccessDeniedException` (HTTP 403) — You don't have sufficient permission to perform
//!   this action.
//! * `ConflictException` (HTTP 409) — Your request has a conflict. For example, you might
//!   receive this error if you try the following: Add, update, or delete a Slack channel
//!   configuration before you add a Slack workspace to your Amazon Web Services account. Add
//!   a Slack channel configuration that already exists in your Amazon Web Services account.
//!   Delete a Slack channel configuration for a live chat channel. Delete a Slack workspace
//!   from your Amazon Web Services account that has an active live chat channel. Call the
//!   RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization API from an Amazon Web Services account that
//!   doesn't belong to an organization. Call the RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization API
//!   from a member account, but the management …
//! * `InternalServerException` (HTTP 500) — We can’t process your request right now because
//!   of a server issue. Try again later.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — The specified resource is missing or doesn't
//!   exist, such as an account alias, Slack channel configuration, or Slack workspace
//!   configuration.
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — Your request input doesn't meet the constraints that
//!   the Amazon Web Services Support App specifies.
