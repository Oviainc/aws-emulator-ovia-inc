//! WHICH datapoints a requested range selects, and which bucket each selected one is reported
//! under, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! ONE rule, asserted over a table: **a read selects every datapoint whose STORED SPAN reaches
//! into the requested range — "The value specified is inclusive; results include data points
//! with the specified time stamp" (`GetMetricStatisticsInput$StartTime`) against "The value
//! specified is exclusive" (`$EndTime`) — where a datapoint's stored span is the one its own
//! `StorageResolution` aggregates it into: its own second for a high-resolution datapoint
//! ("Setting this to 1 specifies this metric as a high-resolution metric, so that CloudWatch
//! stores the metric with sub-minute resolution down to one second") and the whole minute it was
//! published in for a regular-resolution one ("Setting this to 60 specifies this metric as
//! regular resolution, which CloudWatch stores at 1-minute resolution",
//! `smithy_query(query="doc",shape="MetricDatum",member="StorageResolution")`). Each selected
//! datapoint is reported under the period window that span BEGINS in — so a regular-resolution
//! datapoint is reported under its whole minute however short a period the read asked for, even
//! where that minute began before the range did, that minute having no other instant to be
//! reported at.**
//!
//! So the storage granularity decides both the span a range is judged against and the bucket a
//! datapoint is reported at: a regular-resolution datapoint stands for the minute it is stored
//! in, not for the instant inside that minute it happened to be published at.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: where inside its minute the observation
//! is published (the first second, the middle, and the last second — the phase that decides
//! whether the minute it is stored in began before the range did), the resolution it is
//! published at (1, 60 and omitted, which is documented to read as 60), and the period the read
//! asks for (every sub-minute period `MetricStat$Period` admits, plus one minute). Both readers
//! of a series are driven, because one fold answers for both.
