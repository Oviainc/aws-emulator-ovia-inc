//!
//! The rules here are about the ONE policy a cluster carries: what a put stores

//! document's form, size and byte content, along the cluster kind the policy is
//! attached to, and along what makes a `ClusterArn` resolve to no policy
//! (unparsable, another resource kind, never minted, another region, a cluster
//! carrying no policy, a policy already deleted, a cluster already gone).
