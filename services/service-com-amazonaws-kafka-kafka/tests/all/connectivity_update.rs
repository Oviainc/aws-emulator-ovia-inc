//! `UpdateConnectivity`, driven end to end over the same `MultiServiceRouter` the

//! `tests/all/kafka_harness.rs`.
//!
//! RULE under test: an update of a provisioned cluster's connectivity is accepted
//! only for a cluster this endpoint's region holds that is `ACTIVE` and whose
//! stored version is the one the request names, and it is applied
//! asynchronously — the call hands back a cluster-operation ARN and the cluster
//! enters `UPDATING` with that operation as its active one, keeping its old
//! configuration and version; once the clock makes the operation due the
//! submitted settings become the cluster's own, every reader derived from them
//! changes with it, and the cluster gets a new version and returns to `ACTIVE`.
//! A refused call changes nothing.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which part of the
//! connectivity configuration the request carries (public access turned on and
//! turned off, network type, multi-VPC client authentication, several at once),
//! whether it carries ZooKeeper access instead of or beside it, and the cluster
//! it starts from — whose encryption setting and authentication mechanism decide
//! which endpoints the new configuration exposes.
