//! Resource-scoped authorization over the cluster an MSK request names, driven end
//! to end over the same router the emulator serves from.
//!
//! The RULE under test: a cluster-scoped operation decides whether the caller may
//! perform its action on the cluster ARN the request carries BEFORE it resolves
//! that cluster or validates the rest of the body — so a target ARN in an account
//! other than the caller's, which no resource-based policy the caller holds can
//! allow, is refused HTTP 403 with the error code `AccessDeniedException` and the
//! IAM not-authorized-by-resource-policy sentence naming the calling principal, the
//! operation's IAM action and that ARN, whatever the registry does or does not hold
//! under it. The same rule over a role PASSED to the service: `CreateReplicator`
//! accepts a `ServiceExecutionRoleArn` of the caller's account only, and refuses one
//! of another account outright with its own fixed sentence, minting nothing.
//!
//! Each suite asserts that over a TABLE rather than one request. The rows differ
//! along what the rule generalises over: which operation is called (every
//! implemented cluster-scoped one — reads, listings, creates, deletes and updates,
//! on both the `/v1` and the `/api/v2` URI families), which IAM action it is
//! authorized under (`kafka:<ApiName>` for the control plane, `kafka-cluster:Connect`
//! for the Topic Management calls, which reach the cluster's Apache Kafka data
//! plane), how the target ARN travels (an `@httpLabel`, a body member, a query
//! parameter), and the ARN itself (several foreign accounts, another region, another
//! partition, and a resource segment this service never mints).
//!
//! The controls pin the two boundaries: the SAME calls on a cluster ARN of the
//! caller's OWN account are never answered with the denial — they reach the checks
//! and the lookups they always did, and a cluster the caller owns is served — and a
//! request body that is invalid is still refused with the denial when the cluster is
//! foreign, because the decision precedes body validation.
//!
//! The router, the `Reply` wrapper, the percent-encoder and the request builders
//! come from [`crate::kafka_harness`], the crate's shared harness.
