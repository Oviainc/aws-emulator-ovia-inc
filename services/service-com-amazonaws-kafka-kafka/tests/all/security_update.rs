//! `UpdateSecurity`, driven end to end over the same `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! emulator serves from, through the shared harness in
//! `tests/all/kafka_harness.rs`.
//!
//! RULE under test: an update of a provisioned cluster's security settings is
//! accepted only for a cluster this endpoint's region holds that is `ACTIVE` and
//! whose stored version is the one the request names, and it is applied
//! asynchronously — the call hands back a cluster-operation ARN and the cluster
//! enters `UPDATING` with that operation as its active one, keeping its old
//! settings and version; once the clock makes the operation due, each setting the
//! request named is the cluster's own (the client authentication it submitted
//! REPLACES the cluster's, and each of the two encryption settings it named
//! replaces that one while one it omitted is kept), every reader derived from
//! them changes with it, and the cluster gets a new version and returns to
//! `ACTIVE`. A refused call changes nothing.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which of the two
//! settings the request carries (authentication alone, encryption alone, both),
//! which authentication mechanism it turns on or off (SASL/SCRAM, SASL/IAM, TLS,
//! unauthenticated), which `ClientBroker` value and in-cluster setting the
//! encryption names, which part of `EncryptionInfo` it names (in transit, at
//! rest), and the cluster it starts from — whose own settings decide what the
//! replacement changes.
