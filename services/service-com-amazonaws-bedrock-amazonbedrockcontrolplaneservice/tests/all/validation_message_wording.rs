//! The wording of this service's `ValidationException` message, driven end-to-end over
//! the same `MultiServiceRouter` the emulator boots.
//!
//! Two rules are under test, each asserted over a SET of inputs rather than over one
//! recorded request:
//!
//! 1. **A reported `@pattern` is the expression the WHOLE value must match**: an expression
//!    the model ANCHORS is quoted without the `^` / `$` at its ends, and only those (a `^`
//!    inside a character class (`[^:]+`) and a pattern anchored inside each of its
//!    alternatives are reported verbatim). The rows span five modelled patterns across six
//!    operations and three member names; the `.*` form an UNANCHORED expression is quoted
//!    in is the rule of `tests/all/refused_value_is_quoted_by_binding.rs`.
//! 2. **A violation on an ELEMENT of a collection is reported against the collection
//!    MEMBER** — no `<index>.member` step — with that element shape's WHOLE constraint set
//!    nested inside `Member must satisfy constraint: [ … ]`. The rows span two collection
//!    members over different element shapes, one and several offending elements, an
//!    element that breaks two of its shape's constraints at once, and — as the contrast —
//!    a violation on the collection's OWN `@length`, which is not nested.
//! 3. **A clause quotes the value the member held only where the model binds that member to
//!    the request URI**, so an enum-constrained member in the BODY states
//!    `Value at '<path>' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must satisfy enum value set:
//!    [ … ]` while one in the QUERY string quotes the token it refused. The rows span
//!    enum-constrained members of three operations, in the body and in the query string,
//!    over enums of two, three and five values, and assert the WHOLE clause — the set's
//!    membership AND the order the service lists it in, which
//!    `tests/all/enum_value_set_listing.rs` is the rule for. The binding rule itself is
//!    asserted across every constraint class in
//!    `tests/all/refused_value_is_quoted_by_binding.rs`.
//!
//! Every expectation is derived from the model, cited per row
//! (`smithy_query(query="operation")` / `query="shape"`), never from a recorded response
//! body. The requests go through `crate::support` — the ONE harness every suite in this
//! crate drives the emulator with — rather than a second copy of it.
