//! The `com-amazonaws-docdb-amazonrdsv19` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. Return `Some(op)` to route one yourself.
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.

/// The routing key that names THIS service, as opposed to the SigV4 signing name it
/// SHARES with two peers.
///
/// Amazon DocumentDB, Amazon Neptune and Amazon RDS are three emulated services behind
/// ONE signing name. All three are generated from the same `AmazonRDSv19` model, whose
/// `aws.api#service`/`aws.auth#sigv4` traits give each of them `sigv4Name: rds` and
/// `endpointPrefix: rds` (`smithy_query(query="service_info")` on any of the three
/// models), so the default signing-name `can_handle` makes all three claim every
/// `rds`-signed request and the router answers `500 AmbiguousService` for all of it —
/// leaving none of them reachable.
///
/// The shared name resolves to the ONE service whose own identity is that name: Amazon
/// RDS (`sdkId: RDS`, `cloudTrailEventSource: rds.amazonaws.com`), which is also what
/// AWS does — the DocumentDB and Neptune APIs are served on the RDS endpoint. This
/// service therefore claims only a request whose resolved routing key names IT: its own
/// service prefix `docdb` (`sdkId: DocDB`, `cloudTrailEventSource: docdb.amazonaws.com`),
/// which is what a client addressed at this service reaches it by — a credential scope or
/// a host label naming `docdb`.
///
/// An AWS SDK DocumentDB client signs `rds` (the model gives it no other name), so its
/// traffic reaches Amazon RDS, exactly as it does against AWS. Amazon RDS serves it from
/// the co-located model that implements the resource the request names — the DB subnet
/// group and DB cluster parameter group surfaces are served from THIS model, over the one
/// shared engine, so there is one store per AWS resource rather than one per crate (see
/// `services/service-com-amazonaws-rds-amazonrdsv19/src/service.rs`). Where Amazon RDS
/// answers 501 for an operation this service implements, that is the RDS operation's own
/// stub issue, not this routing rule.
