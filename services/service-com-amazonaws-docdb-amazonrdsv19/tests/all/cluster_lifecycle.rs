//! End-to-end tests for the Amazon DocumentDB cluster lifecycle.
//!
//! Every test here drives the service over its real wire protocol (awsQuery form bodies
//! in, XML out) through the same [`MultiServiceRouter`] the production router uses, so a
//! response that is not computed from persisted state cannot pass: a create is always
//! read back through a describe, and a delete is always followed by the describe that
//! must no longer find the resource.
//!
//! The documented rules the service enforces are asserted over TABLES spanning the class
//! the rule generalises over, with each published bound and one step past it. Every rule's
//! source is the Smithy model member documentation, cited on the constant it feeds in
//! `src/state.rs`.
//!
//! The wire harness below ([`Docdb`], [`texts`] and the readers around them) is shared with
//! the other suites in this target — see `tests/all/subnet_and_parameter_groups.rs` — so
//! every suite drives the service exactly the same way.
