//! `DeleteTrustedEntitySet`, end to end over the wire, read back through
//! `GetTrustedEntitySet`.
//!
//! `trusted_entity_set_lifecycle.rs` owns the create-and-read half; this suite owns
//! the delete, which answered HTTP 501 `NotImplemented` and so left the
//! `create -> delete -> gone` half of the state machine unverifiable.
//! Every request goes through
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`] (the harness lives in the
//! `detector_lifecycle` suite), so routing, restJson1 (de)serialization,
//! modelled-constraint validation and the handlers are exercised together.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a SET of inputs rather than one recorded
//! call:
//!
//! 1. `DeleteTrustedEntitySet` COMPLETES: the detector stops holding the set, so
//!    `GetTrustedEntitySet` refuses its id with the entity-set families' absence
//!    refusal — HTTP 404 under the `ResourceNotFoundException` class — straight
//!    after the delete and for ever afterwards, whatever status the set was in when
//!    the delete arrived and whatever the create stored. A SECOND delete is that
//!    same refusal.
//! 2. The delete is PERSISTED and is observable on the detector: its own `UpdatedAt`
//!    moves on the first delete and not on a refused repeat.
//! 3. A deleted set is no longer one GuardDuty keeps, so it occupies none of the
//!    detector's slots: "at any given time, you can have only one trusted entity
//!    set", and a delete frees that one. A replayed `ClientToken` whose set was
//!    deleted mints a new set rather than handing back the deleted one.
//! 4. A delete touches only the set it names: another detector's trusted set and the
//!    same detector's threat entity sets are untouched.
//! 5. An id the store does not resolve is refused the same way as a deleted one, and
//!    a trusted entity set is a sub-resource of a REGIONAL detector, so only the
//!    Region that created it may delete it — where the DETECTOR is what the request
//!    fails to resolve, so the refusal is the detector family's.
