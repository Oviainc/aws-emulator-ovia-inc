//! End-to-end tests for what a detector's own `UpdatedAt` records when a sub-resource
//! is taken OFF it, asserted uniformly over every family a detector holds.
//!
//! Every request goes over the wire through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`, the same
//! path the production router uses, so these tests exercise routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, modelled-constraint validation and the handlers together.
//!
//! The rule under test: a call that changes WHICH sub-resources a detector holds
//! changes the detector record itself, so `GetDetector`'s `UpdatedAt` moves to the
//! instant of that call — and a call that leaves that set alone (a refused delete, a
//! repeated delete of something already gone, a read) moves it nowhere. The answer
//! does not depend on WHICH collection the sub-resource lives in, nor on whether its
//! create minted an id or echoed the caller's name, nor on whether the family's delete
//! drops the record at once or retains it in a terminal `DELETED` status: one rule
//! covers them all.
//!
//! `detector_sub_resource_creates` asserts the other half of the same rule over the
//! families whose create mints an id, and `filter_detector_timestamp` covers the
//! filter family's create. This suite is the DELETE half over the whole class, so no
//! family can answer this question differently from its siblings.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the family and its collection
//! segment, how the delete addresses the sub-resource (a minted id or the caller's
//! name), the `Format` the create carried, whether the caller asked to activate,
//! whether tags were carried, and which status the family's own absence refusal
//! answers. Segments, id members and formats come from
//! `smithy_query(operation="CreateFilter,CreateIPSet,CreateThreatIntelSet,\
//! CreateThreatEntitySet,CreateTrustedEntitySet,CreatePublishingDestination")` and
//! `smithy_query(shape="IpSetFormat,ThreatIntelSetFormat,DestinationType")`.
//!
//! `UpdatedAt` is an ISO-8601 string with a fixed-width millisecond field
//! (`smithy_query(operation="GetDetector")` models it as a String), so these
//! assertions order the instants as text, which is all a client has.
