//! How the entity-set family refuses an identifier it will not act on, across both
//! families (threat and trusted) and all three operations that carry one (the read,
//! the update and the delete).
//!
//! Every request goes over the wire through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` (the
//! harness lives in the `detector_lifecycle` suite), so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, modelled-constraint validation and the handlers are exercised
//! together.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than over one
//! recorded call:
//!
//! 1. An entity-set identifier outside the alphabet the member is constrained to is a
//!    CONSTRAINT violation: HTTP 400 under this service's `InvalidInputException`
//!    class, carrying the validation-error template — how many violations were
//!    detected, the member path the request spelled, and the pattern the value had to
//!    satisfy — and nothing of the caller's value.
//! 2. An identifier of the right FORM that names no set is an ABSENCE: the modelled
//!    HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` with the one fixed sentence the family
//!    words it with, naming neither the member, nor the value, nor which family was
//!    addressed. An id no create minted, a stored id in another spelling, one minted
//!    for the other family and one another detector minted are all that same absence.
//! 3. The constraint is decided from the REQUEST, before anything is resolved, so a
//!    malformed identifier is refused the same way under a detector that does not
//!    exist; an identifier of the right form under such a detector is still the
//!    DETECTOR family's own refusal.
//! 4. Each refusal is a LOOKUP and not a constant: the same operations over the
//!    identifier the create minted succeed, and the stored set survives every refusal.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rules generalise over: the FAMILY, the OPERATION
//! CLASS, and the FORM of the identifier — which character outside the alphabet it
//! carries, its LENGTH (one character up to well past a minted id), its CASE, and
//! whether it was minted at all.
