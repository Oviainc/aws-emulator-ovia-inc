//! What a REFUSED delete, update or acceptance leaves behind, end to end over the
//! wire.
//!
//! Every request goes through [`smithy_server_runtime::MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`]
//! (the harness lives in the `detector_lifecycle` suite), so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, modelled-constraint validation and the handlers are exercised
//! together.
//!
//! The rule under test is the one the `refused_create_clock` suite asserts for the
//! creates, here over the SET of mutating operations that act on a resource the
//! request NAMES and over the SET of ways each of them is refused: a mutating
//! operation reads the service's monotonic "this resource changed now" clock only on
//! the path that actually writes, so a refused call changes nothing at all — it
//! neither moves a resource nor consumes an instant — and the `CreatedAt`/`UpdatedAt`
//! a LATER accepted call stamps therefore still reports the wall-clock instant of
//! that change rather than one pushed into the future by the refusals before it.
//!
//! Observable per request: the clock a mutation reads is what the detector's own
//! `UpdatedAt` records when a sub-resource is added to it
//! (`smithy_query(operation="GetDetector")` models it as a String), so a burst of
//! refused calls between two accepted mutations is enough to see whether the
//! refusals consumed instants: the clock may advance across the burst only by the
//! wall-clock time that really passed over the same span, whereas a handler that
//! reads the clock before it refuses spends an instant per refused call on top of
//! that.
