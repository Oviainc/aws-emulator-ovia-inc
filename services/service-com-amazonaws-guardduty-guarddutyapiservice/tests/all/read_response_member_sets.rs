//! The MEMBER SET a successful read answers with, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every request goes through [`smithy_server_runtime::MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`]
//! (the harness lives in the `detector_lifecycle` suite), so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, modelled-constraint validation and the handlers are exercised
//! together.
//!
//! The ONE rule under test, in the five places this service applies it, each asserted
//! over a SET of inputs rather than one recorded call: a 200 answer carries the member
//! set GuardDuty carries — every member the service always emits is present, with the
//! value the stored state gives it or the EMPTY form (an empty map, the empty token, a
//! `null`) where the state holds nothing — and it invents nothing for state that does
//! not exist.
//!
//! 1. An entity-set read reports the account that owns the S3 bucket its `location`
//!    names: the `expectedBucketOwner` a create or update supplied, and the account the
//!    request was signed for when neither supplied one. (`GetIPSet` and
//!    `GetThreatIntelSet` document the opposite for the same member — "this field
//!    appears in the response only if it was provided during … creation or update" —
//!    and the entity-set operations document no such qualification, so they always
//!    report it.)
//! 2. `GetMalwareScanSettings.scanResourceCriteria` carries BOTH `include` and
//!    `exclude` on every read, each an empty map where the detector carries no
//!    criterion of that kind, so a read round-trips into
//!    `UpdateMalwareScanSettings`.
//! 3. `GetAdministratorAccount.administrator` and `GetMasterAccount.master` are always
//!    on the wire, carrying `null` where no administrator relationship exists, never an
//!    empty object a client would read as "there is an administrator".
//! 4. Every `GetDetector` `features` entry carries the member set
//!    `{name, status, updatedAt, additionalConfiguration}`, and the data-source view of
//!    a feature reports the enablement the detector was created with — RDS login events
//!    included, which a create that names no features enables ("with an exception to
//!    RUNTIME_MONITORING, all the optional features are enabled by default").
//! 5. `GetUsageStatistics` reports `nextToken` on every page, as the position of the
//!    next page while one remains and as the EMPTY string on the terminal page.
//!
//! The same rule over `GetCoverageStatistics` (one entry per group of the statistic's
//! dimension, counting zero where nothing fell) and over `ListCoverage` (no `resources`
//! member at all on a page that matches no row) is asserted in the `coverage_statistics`
//! and `coverage_listing` suites, beside the rest of those operations' behaviour.
