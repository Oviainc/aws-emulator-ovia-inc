//! @op GetOrganizationStatistics
//! IMPLEMENTED: reports the organization's GuardDuty coverage, counted off the
//! membership and the feature switches this service persists.
//!
//! "Retrieves how many active member accounts have each feature enabled within
//! GuardDuty" (`smithy_query(query="doc",shape="GetOrganizationStatistics")`), so every
//! number below is a COUNT over stored records, never a canned figure:
//!
//! * `totalAccountsCount` — "total number of accounts in your organization": the
//!   administrator's own account plus one per member record it holds.
//! * `memberAccountsCount` — the accounts "that are associated with GuardDuty": the
//!   member records that are still ASSOCIATED
//!   ([`crate::state::MemberRecord::is_associated`]), which is what `DisassociateMembers`
//!   ends and `CreateMembers` begins.
//! * `activeAccountsCount` — the "active accounts" among them: a member whose monitoring
//!   `StopMonitoringMembers` has stopped ("stops GuardDuty monitoring for the specified
//!   member accounts") is not active, so it is the associated members that are not
//!   [`crate::state::RELATIONSHIP_DISABLED`].
//! * `enabledAccountsCount` — "total number of accounts that have enabled GuardDuty":
//!   those monitored members, plus the administrator's own account when its detector's
//!   `Status` is [`crate::state::ENABLED`].
//! * `countByFeature` — "the coverage statistics for each feature", so one entry per
//!   `OrgFeature` member ([`crate::state::ORG_FEATURES`]), each carrying how many of the
//!   ACTIVE member accounts hold that feature's switch at
//!   [`crate::state::ENABLED`] — what `UpdateMemberDetectors` writes and
//!   `GetMemberDetectors` reports.
//! * `updatedAt` — "the timestamp at which the organization statistics was last
//!   updated": the latest instant any record these counts read last changed, so it moves
//!   when the answer can have moved and never otherwise. Absent while the endpoint holds
//!   no detector at all, because then nothing has been recorded to have an instant.
//!
//! A pure report: it takes the store's guard, counts, and releases it, so a later caller
//! sees exactly what this one saw. The operation names no detector
//! (`GET /organization/statistics`), so the organization it reports is the one the Region
//! the request was signed for serves — the same resolution `GetInvitationsCount` makes,
//! for the same reason: a GuardDuty detector is a regional resource.
//!
//! Hand-authored rather than scaffolded: the op-stub generator declined this operation
//! because its input is `smithy.api#Unit` (recorded in `src/ops/SKIPPED_STUBS.md`), so it
//! had no handler file, no place in the service's `operations(...)` allow-list and was
//! answered by the framework's unroutable-operation path — a 501 in no shape this
//! service's model declares. `build.rs` derives that allow-list from the `//! @op <Name>`
//! header of every `src/ops/*.rs`, so this file is what wires it.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read it through the guard it hands back; never
//! construct an engine in a handler.
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//!
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `GetOrganizationStatistics`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-guardduty-guarddutyapiservice/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-guardduty-guarddutyapiservice.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Retrieves how many active member accounts have each feature enabled within GuardDuty.
//! Only a delegated GuardDuty administrator of an organization can run this API. When you
//! create a new organization, it might take up to 24 hours to generate the statistics for
//! the entire organization.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! `smithy.api#Unit` — no members. Bound to `GET /organization/statistics`.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `OrganizationDetails` (OrganizationDetails) — Information about the statistics report
//!   for your organization.
//!   * `UpdatedAt` (Timestamp) — The timestamp at which the organization statistics was
//!     last updated. This is in UTC format.
//!   * `OrganizationStatistics` (OrganizationStatistics) — Information about the GuardDuty
//!     coverage statistics for members in your organization.
//!     * `TotalAccountsCount` (Integer) — Total number of accounts in your organization.
//!     * `MemberAccountsCount` (Integer) — Total number of accounts in your organization
//!       that are associated with GuardDuty.
//!     * `ActiveAccountsCount` (Integer) — Total number of active accounts in your
//!       organization that are associated with GuardDuty.
//!     * `EnabledAccountsCount` (Integer) — Total number of accounts that have enabled
//!       GuardDuty.
//!     * `CountByFeature` (OrganizationFeatureStatisticsResults) — Retrieves the coverage
//!       statistics for each feature.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `BadRequestException` (HTTP 400) — A bad request exception object.
//! * `InternalServerErrorException` (HTTP 500) — An internal server error exception object.
