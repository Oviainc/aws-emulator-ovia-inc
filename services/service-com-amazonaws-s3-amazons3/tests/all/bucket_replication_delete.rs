//! End-to-end tests for `DeleteBucketReplication`: WITHDRAWING a general purpose bucket's
//! replication configuration.
//!
//! Every assertion drives a real HTTP request through the router (the harness the
//! bucket-lifecycle suite owns), so what is pinned is the wire behaviour — status, body,
//! error code — rather than any handler's internals.
//!
//! The rules under test, with their sources:
//!
//! * `DeleteBucketReplication` "deletes the replication configuration from the bucket"
//!   (the operation's own documentation): the WHOLE subresource goes, whatever the
//!   configuration named, so the bucket is back in the state it was created in and
//!   `GetBucketReplication` reports `ReplicationConfigurationNotFoundError` (HTTP 404)
//!   again. The call answers the modelled 204 with an empty body.
//! * Removing a subresource is IDEMPOTENT: a bucket that carries no configuration is
//!   already in the asked-for state, so a delete against it — and a second delete after a
//!   first — still answers 204.
//! * Only that one subresource is withdrawn: the bucket's versioning status, its tag set
//!   and its objects survive the delete, and a later `PutBucketReplication` associates a
//!   configuration again.
//! * `Bucket` is an @httpLabel, so a call naming a bucket this emulator does not hold
//!   answers `NoSuchBucket` (HTTP 404); an `ExpectedBucketOwner` that is not this
//!   account's answers `AccessDenied` (HTTP 403) and leaves the configuration in place.
