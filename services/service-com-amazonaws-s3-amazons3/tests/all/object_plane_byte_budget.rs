//! What ONE bucket may hold: the traffic AWS accepts, not a slice of it.
//!
//! Every assertion drives a real HTTP request through the router, so what is pinned is the
//! wire behaviour a client doing ordinary object traffic sees.
//!
//! The rule under test: the emulator's capacity ceilings are not part of the modelled API
//! surface. S3 constrains the size of ONE payload — the 5 MiB minimum for a part other than
//! the last and the 5 GiB maximum for a part or a `PutObject` body (Amazon S3 User Guide,
//! *Amazon S3 multipart upload limits*) — and bounds what a bucket HOLDS not at all, while
//! `UploadPart` models no error whatsoever
//! (`smithy_query(query="operation",operation="UploadPart")` reports `errors: []`). So the
//! budgets this emulator keeps to bound its own memory are sized ABOVE the traffic AWS
//! accepts: a write whose size S3 accepts is RECORDED however many MiB the bucket already
//! holds, and a multipart upload of many MiB completes and reads back byte-exact.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: how the bytes arrive (a one-shot
//! `PutObject`, a multipart upload split at the part size the high-level clients choose),
//! how many MiB the bucket already holds when they do, and the sizes themselves — each
//! object here is larger than a bucket's whole allowance used to be, and the bucket ends up
//! holding several times it.
