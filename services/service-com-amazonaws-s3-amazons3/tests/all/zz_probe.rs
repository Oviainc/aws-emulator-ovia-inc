//! The PROBE a parallel-download client makes before it fans out, end to end.
//!
//! Every parallel-download path (the AWS CRT, `s3transfer`, `aws s3 cp`) discovers an
//! object's part boundaries with ONE part-scoped `HeadObject` and then reads the object in
//! pieces — by part number or by byte range — so this suite drives that whole workflow
//! through the router and reassembles the object from the pieces it got back.
//!
//! The rule under test, over a multipart object and a one-shot one: the pieces a client is
//! told about add up to the object. A part-scoped read reports the object's part count
//! (`PartsCount`) and the span of the part it served (`Content-Range`), each span is the
//! bytes of exactly that part, and reading every span in order — once by part number, once
//! by the byte ranges those `Content-Range` headers name — reproduces the object's bytes
//! and its reported size.
//!
//! The spans and counts here are COMPUTED from the parts each case uploads rather than
//! written down, so the suite spans part counts (one, two, three) and part sizes rather
//! than one recorded object.
