//! End-to-end cover for what a bucket's replication configuration DOES: the object
//! versions it copies, where, and what the source version then reports.
//!
//! Every assertion drives a real HTTP request through the router, so what is pinned is the
//! wire behaviour (status, bound headers, payload elements) rather than any handler's
//! internals.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a SET of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. A write into a bucket with an ENABLED rule that covers the key copies the version to
//!    the destination the rule names, byte-identically and under the same key and version
//!    id, where it reads back as a `REPLICA`. A rule that does not cover the key — another
//!    prefix, another tag — and a rule that is `Disabled` copy nothing.
//! 2. The source version reports the replication: `PENDING` while it is in flight and
//!    `COMPLETED` once it has settled, and `FAILED` when the destination the rule names
//!    cannot be written.
//! 3. Nothing already in the bucket is copied: an object written before the configuration
//!    was set stays where it is.
//! 4. A delete marker is replicated only by a rule that asks for it, and the permanent
//!    delete of one version is never replicated.
//! 5. A write into the destination bucket does not come back: a replica is not replicated,
//!    and a bucket with no configuration of its own replicates nothing.
