//! End-to-end tests for WHICH task instances a run holds when the workflow has more than
//! one version: the ones declared by the version THAT run executes.
//!
//! The rule under test: a run executes the task graph of the workflow version it was
//! started under — the one `StartWorkflowRun`'s `WorkflowVersion` named, else the latest
//! at that moment — and a version is immutable ("takes a snapshot of the definition at
//! creation time, so subsequent changes to the Amazon S3 object will not affect the
//! workflow unless you create a new version",
//! `smithy_query(query="shape", shape="GetWorkflowResponse")`, `WorkflowDefinition`), so
//! the instances a run holds are exactly the instances of the tasks THAT version's
//! definition declared: each one is discoverable through `RunDetail.TaskInstances`,
//! readable with 200 through `GetTaskInstance` reporting the version the run executes, and
//! a task only ANOTHER version declares resolves to nothing in this run.
//!
//! This is the version dimension of the records `run_execution_outcome` covers for a
//! single-version workflow, and of the reader agreement `run_task_instances` covers: a
//! client that updates a workflow while a run is in flight, or that starts a run on an
//! earlier version, still inspects the tasks that run actually executes.
//!
//! Every test drives the real wire path through the same router the emulator boots, with
//! the Amazon S3 service mounted beside this one on ONE shared engine, because a run's
//! tasks come from the definition its version snapshotted out of Amazon S3. The table
//! spans what the rule generalises over: how the update changes the declared tasks (adds
//! one, removes some, replaces every identifier, declares the first ones where there were
//! none), the DEPENDENCY SHAPE on either side (independent tasks, a chain), and the FORM
//! the definition is written in (block YAML, JSON — YAML 1.2 is a superset of JSON).
