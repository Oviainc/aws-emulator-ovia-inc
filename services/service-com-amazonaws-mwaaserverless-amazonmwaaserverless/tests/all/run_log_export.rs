//! End-to-end tests for where a workflow run's own execution output GOES: the CloudWatch
//! Logs log group the workflow's `LoggingConfiguration` names.
//!
//! The RULE every row asserts: a workflow that configures a log group has what its runs
//! produce exported to that group — "Logs are automatically exported to your specified
//! CloudWatch log group using remote logging functionality" over output that "capture[s]
//! workflow execution details, task-level information, and system events"
//! (`smithy_query(query="doc", shape="LoggingConfiguration")`), stored under the group
//! `LogGroupName` names — so CloudWatch Logs' OWN readers find the group, a stream per unit
//! of the execution (the run, and each task-instance attempt the run ran) and the events
//! those units produced; and each task instance that executed reports the stream it wrote
//! to as `LogStream` ("The CloudWatch log stream name for this task instance execution"),
//! which is a stream that group really holds. A workflow that configures NO log group has
//! nowhere documented for its output to go, so nothing is exported and its instances report
//! no `LogStream`.
//!
//! CloudWatch Logs is mounted beside this service on ONE engine and asked through its own
//! `DescribeLogGroups`, `DescribeLogStreams` and `GetLogEvents` — the shape
//! `core/router/src/lib.rs` mounts every service in — because the groups, streams and
//! events are that service's, and a reported stream name that names nothing would be a
//! resource no reader can reach.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: how many tasks the definition
//! declares and in which dependency SHAPE (none, one, a chain, a fan-out and join), whether
//! the run SUCCEEDS or FAILS, the FORM of the configured log group name (a path, a plain
//! name, the punctuation CloudWatch Logs admits), and whether a group is configured at all.
