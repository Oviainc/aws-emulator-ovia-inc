//! End-to-end tests for the `OperatorName` a task instance reports out of the operator
//! its workflow definition declared.
//!
//! The rule under test: a value this service reports out of the caller's definition file
//! is reported only when it is one the modelled member that carries it can hold. Both
//! `GetTaskInstanceResponse$OperatorName` and `TaskInstanceSummary$OperatorName` target
//! `GenericString`, modelled `@length(min: 1, max: 255)` with `@pattern(^.*$)`
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape",
//! shape="GetTaskInstanceResponse,TaskInstanceSummary,GenericString")`), so a declared
//! operator name inside those constraints is reported verbatim by both readers and one
//! outside them is reported as no member at all — never clipped, because a cut operator
//! name names a different operator than the definition declared. The task still runs
//! either way: an operator name is not what an instance is reported BY, so the run
//! executes the task and reports its outcome whatever the declaration carried.
//!
//! Every test drives the real wire path through the same router the emulator boots, with
//! the Amazon S3 service mounted beside this one on ONE shared engine, because a
//! definition is a YAML object a run's version snapshotted out of Amazon S3. The first
//! table spans what the declared VALUE varies over: whether an operator is declared at
//! all, both published length bounds and one character past each of them, a declaration
//! of several hundred characters, the same lengths written in multi-byte characters (the
//! modelled length counts characters, not bytes), a value whose punctuation and spaces no
//! identifier would carry but the member's pattern does, and a value carrying a line
//! break, which that pattern does not.
//!
//! The second table spans where that value is WRITTEN, because the rule is about the
//! member the value is reported through and not about the spelling the definition
//! declared it with: every key a task entry may name its operator under, crossed with
//! every form a definition may write that entry in, each with a value the member carries
//! and one past its maximum.
