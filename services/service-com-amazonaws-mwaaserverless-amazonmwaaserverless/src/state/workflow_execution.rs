//! The DAG a workflow run EXECUTES: the tasks the run's version declared, the order the
//! dependencies between them put those tasks in, and what the run therefore finishes as.
//!
//! `StartWorkflowRun` "creates a workflow run that executes the tasks defined in your
//! workflow definition", and a definition "defines the workflow structure using supported
//! Amazon Web Services operators and tasks" with "task dependencies" in it
//! (`smithy_query(query="doc", shape="CreateWorkflowRequest",
//! member="DefinitionS3Location")`). So a run is not a status that moves on its own: it is
//! the execution of the task graph its version froze, and the status it finishes in is the
//! one that execution produced.
//!
//! The plan is built ONCE, when the run is recorded, out of the definition that version
//! snapshotted — a version is immutable, so what it holds IS what the run executes, and a
//! plan built once is what makes two reads of the same run answer identically. Nothing is
//! slept on: the plan says what happens and at which dependency LEVEL, and
//! [`crate::state::WorkflowRun::settle`] materialises each level as the clock makes it
//! due.
//!
//! ## What the plan decides
//!
//! * A graph that can be ordered runs: every task declared in it gets one task instance,
//!   the tasks that wait for nothing run first, and a task runs once the tasks it
//!   declared as dependencies have finished. The run finishes in the modelled `SUCCESS`
//!   status with no `ErrorMessage`, which is the outcome `WorkflowRunDetail$ErrorMessage`
//!   documents ("This value is null if the run completed successfully").
//! * Which of the values the definition DECLARES each instance reports: a value read out
//!   of the caller's definition is reported only when it is one the modelled member that
//!   carries it can hold, so an operator name outside that member is not reported at all
//!   and an unreportable task identifier makes the graph unbuildable, because an instance
//!   is reported BY its identifier.
//! * A graph that CANNOT be ordered is a workflow definition no run of it can execute: a
//!   task that depends on a task the definition does not declare, a dependency cycle, two
//!   tasks declaring one identifier, a task identifier outside what the modelled
//!   `TaskInstanceId`/`TaskId` can carry, or more tasks than
//!   [`workflow_definition::MAX_DECLARED_TASKS`]. Such a run reaches the modelled `FAILED`
//!   status with an `ErrorMessage` naming the condition and the task it was found on, and
//!   holds no task instance: nothing of it ran.
//!
//! What a task's operator DOES to the resources it names is the operator's own work
//! against another service, performed by the worker the real service runs it on; this
//! emulator serves the orchestration — admitting the run, building the graph, ordering it
//! and recording an instance per task through the modelled statuses — and carries out no
//! operator's side effect. Nothing here invents a failure for a task either: a task
//! instance reports the outcome of the orchestration it took part in.
