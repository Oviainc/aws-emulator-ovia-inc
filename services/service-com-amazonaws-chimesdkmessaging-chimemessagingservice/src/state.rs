//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-chimesdkmessaging-chimemessagingservice service.
//!
//! The channel-messaging slice keeps every channel this service minted, keyed by its
//! ARN, and the messages sent to each one inside that channel's record — so deleting a
//! channel drops its messages with it and no second map can disagree about either. The
//! channel FLOWS this service minted are kept the same way, keyed by their own ARN.
//!
//! Timestamps are held as epoch MILLISECONDS rather than as
//! [`aws_smithy_types::DateTime`], because the list operations have to order and range
//! filter them and `DateTime` carries no total order. [`date_time`] converts one back
//! for the wire and [`millis_of`] converts an inbound filter bound in.
//!
//! Three things this service reads are NOT in the struct below, because another Chime
//! service reads or writes them too and the engine keys state by type: the app-instance
//! ADMIN directory ([`app_instance_admins`]), the family's ARN-keyed TAG directory
//! ([`chime_tags`]), which holds the tags of every channel and channel flow — including
//! the ones a create was given — and the family's identity NAME directory
//! ([`identity_names`]), which is where the name of the `AppInstanceUser` or
//! `AppInstanceBot` an [`Identity`] names is published.
//!
//! A participant is therefore stored as its ARN alone: every `Identity` this service puts
//! on the wire is PROJECTED from that ARN at read time ([`identity_of`]), so a renamed
//! identity is reported under its current name rather than the one it carried when the
//! membership, ban, moderator, channel or message was written.

/// non-empty), precisely because the value ends up in an endpoint URL's authority. The
