//! What `ListServices` publishes as a service's DISPLAY NAME, and that the same string
//! is the one every quota listing of that code reports.
//!
//! THE RULE, over the whole integrated-service inventory rather than over one entry:
//! `ListServices` reports one `ServiceInfo` per integrated `ServiceCode`, whose
//! `ServiceName` is the display name the inventory gives THAT code — reproduced as the
//! inventory spells it (with or without an `AWS`/`Amazon` prefix, with the case it uses
//! for a product name, with a parenthesised code, even when it is not a product name at
//! all), never a sibling code's name, and never the `ServiceCode` echoed back — and the
//! same string is what `ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas` / `ListServiceQuotas` report in
//! `ServiceQuota.ServiceName` for that code (`smithy_query(query="shape",
//! shape="ServiceInfo")`: `ServiceInfo{ServiceCode @length 1..63 @pattern
//! ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,63}$, ServiceName}`).
//!
//! Why these suites: `ListServices` is the discovery call for a `ServiceCode`, so a code
//! it omits is unreachable and a name that is really the code — or the neighbouring
//! service's name — makes the listing useless for display and for matching a service by
//! name. The one code with no citable display name is the exception
//! `catalog_identity.rs` pins the exact set of; everything here is about the codes that
//! DO have one.
//!
//! The harness (`client`, `emulator`, `service_inventory`, `default_quotas`) is the one
//! `quota_workflow.rs` owns.
