//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-connectcontactlens-amazonconnectcontactlens service.
//!
//! Contact Lens has NO public write API. The real-time analysis segments of a contact
//! are produced by Amazon Connect's voice analysis while the call runs, and
//! `ListRealtimeContactAnalysisSegments` only *reports* them. The create side of the
//! lifecycle therefore lives here, as an in-process seeding API on the state struct
//! ([`ComAmazonawsConnectcontactlensAmazonconnectcontactlensState::put_session`],
//! [`ComAmazonawsConnectcontactlensAmazonconnectcontactlensState::append_segments`],
//! [`ComAmazonawsConnectcontactlensAmazonconnectcontactlensState::complete_session`])
//! which the producing side — a test today, the Amazon Connect emulator's contact flow
//! later — drives through the one shared engine. The operation handler never writes a
//! segment; the only state change it makes is materialising the 24-hour expiry the
//! clock already made due, plus the page cursor it hands back.
