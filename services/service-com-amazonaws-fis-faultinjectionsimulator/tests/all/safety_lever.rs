//! AWS FIS's safety lever — `GetSafetyLever` and `UpdateSafetyLeverState` — end to end
//! over HTTP.
//!
//! Every assertion here goes through the router, so each case exercises routing,
//! deserialization, the handler, the persisted state and serialization — the same path a
//! client takes. The rules under test are the ones FIS states for the lever:
//!
//! * an account HAS one safety lever, which no API creates, lists or deletes, so it is
//!   named by the id FIS gives it and reports `disengaged` under its initial reason until
//!   an update stores something, under the lever's ARN in the Region the request is signed
//!   for;
//! * the state a request asks for is PERSISTED: `GetSafetyLever` reports the status and
//!   the reason the last `UpdateSafetyLeverState` stored, whatever order the two
//!   admissible states are asked for in and however often;
//! * engaging the lever TAKES EFFECT rather than landing at once — the lever reports the
//!   modelled `engaging`, which no `SafetyLeverStatusInput` can ask for, until the clock
//!   says it has — while disengaging it lands immediately;
//! * engaging it stops the experiments that are running and keeps new ones from starting,
//!   and disengaging it lets them start again;
//! * an `id` that names no lever of this account answers `ResourceNotFoundException`
//!   (HTTP 404), and a `status` outside the input enum `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) —
//!   neither persisting anything;
//! * reading the lever changes nothing a later caller sees.
//!
//! The HTTP harness below is local to this suite, as each sibling suite's is.
