//! The ONE filter-matching rule this service's listings narrow by, driven end to end over
//! HTTP through each listing that shares it.
//!
//! `ListEnabledControls`, `ListEnabledBaselines` and `ListControlOperations` all ask the
//! same question of a `filter` member — does this record's own value for the member appear
//! among the values the caller sent? — so the rule is written once, in `crate::state`, and
//! each handler reaches it there. This suite drives that single path through all three
//! listings, so a change to it that narrowed one listing differently from its siblings
//! fails here.
//!
//! Driven through the same [`MultiServiceRouter`] the production emulator dispatches with,
//! so what these tests exercise is the wire behaviour a client sees.
//!
//! The rule, stated once in [`selected_by_the_rule`] and asserted over a TABLE of inputs
//! rather than one case:
//!
//! * a member the caller omits narrows nothing, in either shape an omission takes (no
//!   `filter` at all, or a `filter` carrying no member);
//! * a member they send keeps the records whose own reported value for it is one of the
//!   values sent — whatever the member is, and however many values it carries, up to the
//!   modelled maximum length of that list;
//! * a record with NO value for a sent member is not selected, so a member no record here
//!   has a value for selects nothing;
//! * the members narrow TOGETHER: a record must satisfy every member sent.
//!
//! Every expected set is computed from the listing's own unfiltered answer by that one
//! rule, so no case repeats an identifier or a status the fixture minted.
//!
//! The value sets and list bounds written out by hand name their source. The enum value
//! sets come from `smithy_query(query="shape", shape="EnablementStatus,DriftStatus,
//! EnabledBaselineDriftStatus,ControlOperationStatus,ControlOperationType")` and the
//! maximum length of each `filter` list from `smithy_query(query="shape",
//! shape="EnabledControlFilter,EnabledBaselineFilter,ControlOperationFilter")` on this
//! crate's `smithy-model/`: 1 for every member of `EnabledControlFilter` and
//! `ControlOperationFilter`, and 5 for `EnabledBaselineFilter`'s `targetIdentifiers`,
//! `baselineIdentifiers` and `parentIdentifiers`. The baselines the fixture enables are
//! the `enablements()` table the sibling `baseline_operations` suite drives
//! `EnableBaseline` with, so no baseline, version or target is written out here.
