//! How this service states a request it refuses at its boundary, end to end: the clause a
//! broken modelled constraint is reported with, over a TABLE of inputs rather than the one
//! request a recorded unit happened to send.
//!
//! Four rules are pinned here, each over several operations, members, constraint classes
//! and list positions:
//!
//! 1. A refusal of a value outside an enumerated type lists the values the service
//!    ACCEPTS — which for a filter key whose published set has outgrown this checkout's
//!    model is more than the model declares — in the order the service lists them, which
//!    is neither the model's declaration order nor lexicographic.
//! 2. A clause quotes the value it refused, except in the operations whose refusals state
//!    none: those name the member and the requirement alone, whatever constraint class was
//!    broken and whatever position in a list the member sat at.
//! 3. A clause stated at a COLLECTION member quotes the collection the caller submitted,
//!    rendered `[<element>, …]` — never a count of its elements, which no caller sent.
//! 4. A managed-node filter value outside the set its key publishes is the modelled
//!    filter-value error of the operation that read it, naming the key and the values it
//!    accepts as the API publishes them, whichever operator the filter named.
//!
//! Every case goes through the front door a client uses — the shared harness in
//! `all/parameter_store.rs` ([`router`], [`call`]) dispatches `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: AmazonSSM.<Operation>` through the multi-service router.
