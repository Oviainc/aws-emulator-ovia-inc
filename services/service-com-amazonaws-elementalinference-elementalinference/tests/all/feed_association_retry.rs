//! A REPEAT of an `AssociateFeed` that was already served, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case here drives the real request path — the router picks the service from the
//! SigV4 credential scope, the framework deserializes and validates the body, the
//! handler runs, and the response is serialized as `restJson1` — so what these tests
//! assert is what a client sees.
//!
//! THE RULE under test: `AssociateFeed` is `@idempotent` and its
//! `associatedResourceName` is the operation's `@idempotencyToken`
//! (`smithy_query(query="operation",operation="AssociateFeed")`), so a request that
//! repeats one the feed has already served is that one request once more rather than a
//! second append: its effect is applied ONCE. An output the feed already holds exactly
//! as the request describes it is therefore in place already — it is neither appended a
//! second time nor refused — so:
//!
//! * a repeat of the whole request answers the first call's success and leaves the feed
//!   exactly as that call left it, with ONE copy of each output;
//! * a request that repeats some outputs and carries one the feed does not hold yet
//!   appends exactly that one ("New outputs will be appended");
//! * an output whose name the feed holds under a DIFFERENT definition is not a repeat:
//!   appending it would MODIFY an existing output, which this operation cannot do, so it
//!   stays the modelled `ConflictException` (HTTP 409) and nothing is written — including
//!   when the output the feed holds under that name did not enter through an
//!   association.
//!
//! The first rule is asserted over a TABLE whose rows differ along what it generalises
//! over — how many outputs the repeated request carries (none, one, several), which
//! `OutputConfig` member each carries, their statuses and descriptions, the form and
//! length of the resource name (the character classes its pattern `^[\w \-\.',@:;/]*$`
//! admits, at the minimum and the maximum of its `@length` 1..2048), and how many times
//! the request is repeated, with and without `dryRun` on the repeat.
