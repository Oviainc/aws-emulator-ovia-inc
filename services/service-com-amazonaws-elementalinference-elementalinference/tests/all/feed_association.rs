//! The feed ASSOCIATION, end to end over the wire: `AssociateFeed` and
//! `DisassociateFeed`, read back through `GetFeed` and `ListFeeds`.
//!
//! Every case here drives the real request path — the router picks the service from the
//! SigV4 credential scope, the framework deserializes and validates the body, the
//! handler runs, and the response is serialized as `restJson1` — so what these tests
//! assert is what a client sees.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded
//! case:
//!
//! * `AssociateFeed` CLAIMS a feed for one resource and APPENDS the request's outputs to
//!   the stored ones ("New outputs will be appended"), each appended output reporting
//!   `fromAssociation: true`; the claimed feed reports `ACTIVE` and its association;
//! * a feed takes an association only from a status that admits one — `AVAILABLE`, or
//!   `ACTIVE` for the resource that already holds it; from any other status, and for a
//!   second, different resource ("you can associate only one resource with each feed"),
//!   the call is refused with the modelled `ValidationException` carrying that rule's
//!   invariant sentence, and the stored feed is left exactly as it was (how a refusal is
//!   WORDED is `error_message_rule.rs`);
//! * an output that would MODIFY an existing one (same name) is a `ConflictException`,
//!   and a feed's output list is BOUNDED: an append past the quota answers the modelled
//!   `ServiceQuotaExceededException`;
//! * `associatedResourceName` "must not resemble an ARN", a rule its own pattern cannot
//!   express — and one judged over the whole value, including the non-ASCII word
//!   characters that pattern admits;
//! * `DisassociateFeed` RELEASES the named resource, disables every output and archives
//!   the feed, irreversibly: an `ARCHIVED` feed takes no further association and cannot
//!   be released again; a name that is not the associated resource's is refused;
//! * `dryRun` on either operation validates and persists NOTHING, so a later read
//!   reports the feed unchanged;
//! * an id no live feed has is `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) on both.
