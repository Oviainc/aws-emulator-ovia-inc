//! The state gate every call that starts work on a connector runs, driven end to
//! end through BOTH operations that start one: `RestartConnector` and
//! `UpdateConnector`.
//!
//! RULE. A call that only a running connector can serve is refused, for a
//! connector in ANY other `ConnectorState`, with `BadRequestException` (HTTP
//! 400) blaming `connectorArn` and reading `Invalid parameter connectorArn: The
//! connector is not RUNNING.` — the same status, code, blamed member and message
//! whichever of those calls made it — and is served only while the connector is
//! `RUNNING`.
//!
//! Every case drives the emulator the way a client does: a buffered `restJson1`
//! request through the same router the production binary assembles, with the
//! response body read back as JSON. Nothing reaches into the state struct, so a
//! handler running a gate of its own would fail here.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over: the `ConnectorState` the
//! connector is in when the call lands — every non-running state this service
//! puts a connector in (`CREATING` while its workers come up, `RESTARTING`,
//! `UPDATING` and `DELETING`) — crossed with each call the gate guards, plus the
//! `RUNNING` row where both calls are served. `ConnectorState` also lists
//! `FAILED` (`smithy_query query="shape" shape="ConnectorState"`), which no call
//! of this emulator puts a connector in, so no row can reach it.
//!
//! The sibling suites' request helpers are private to their own modules, so this
//! one carries its own copies of the few it needs.
