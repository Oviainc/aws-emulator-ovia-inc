//! The PORTAL data plane: the developer-portal website a published portal serves on the
//! domain this service generates for it.
//!
//! A portal is reached at the host its own `EndpointConfigurationResponse` reports — "This
//! domain name is generated and managed by API Gateway"
//! (`EndpointConfigurationResponse$PortalDefaultDomainName`), or the `DomainName` the
//! account brought with it — and `PublishPortal` is what puts content on that host:
//! "Publishes a portal". The request a consumer then makes is an ORDINARY HTTP request to
//! a website, which is no modelled operation of this service at all, so the emulator's
//! front door could resolve no target service for it and answered `404 UnknownService` —
//! for the domain this very service told the caller to use. A caller could therefore not
//! observe the thing publishing a portal exists to do, and — the security-relevant half —
//! could not tell whether `DisablePortal` actually took the site offline: an emulator that
//! only flips `PublishStatus` while nothing is served, or while something is served
//! regardless, lets a revocation silently pass.
//!
//! This module is therefore the third data-plane half of
//! [`crate::service::EmulatedService`] (beside [`super::invoke`]'s and
//! [`super::websocket`]'s): the claim ([`claims_parts`], read by `Service::can_handle`) and
//! the serving ([`serve`], reached from `Service::override_routing_error`, which the router
//! reaches BEFORE authentication — a consumer of a developer portal holds no AWS
//! credential). It is a READ of this service's own records: a visit changes nothing, and
//! every status and byte it answers is computed from them.
//!
//! # What it serves, and what decides it
//!
//! 1. the request names a `Portal` this service holds — by the host, which is that portal's
//!    own generated domain or the custom domain it carries, or, for a client that cannot
//!    resolve either, by the portal's endpoint behind the emulator's reserved path marker
//!    ([`resolve`]);
//! 2. the portal's domain serves the build of its LAST SETTLED PUBLISH
//!    ([`crate::state::Portal::live_site`]): `PublishPortal` builds the content the portal
//!    held when it was called and that build goes live when the publish settles, so a
//!    portal nothing has published yet serves nothing, a write to the portal's content
//!    changes nothing that is already live, and a `DisablePortal` takes the live build
//!    down from the instant it is ACCEPTED — a revocation of public access does not wait
//!    for its `PublishStatus` to settle, so the site cannot be served to a caller who has
//!    already revoked it. A domain serving nothing is `403` `{"message":"Forbidden"}` — the
//!    answer this service's other data planes give for an endpoint that serves nothing;
//! 3. the live build is rendered as the portal's page ([`site_page`]): its `PortalContent`
//!    — display name, description and the theme's own colours — over the portal products
//!    the build included, each with the product pages and product REST endpoint pages that
//!    product holds. Every value on the page is read from the store; nothing about a
//!    product, a page or an endpoint is invented;
//! 4. the preview `PreviewPortal` builds is served on the path `Preview$PreviewUrl`
//!    announces ([`crate::state::portal_preview_url`]), from the portal's CURRENT content —
//!    that is what a preview is — once that build is ready, and `403` until then;
//! 5. anything else under the domain is `404` `{"message":"Not Found"}`: the portal serves
//!    the host, but has no page there.
//!
//! What this does NOT do, stated so a served page is not read as more than it is: a
//! portal whose `Authorization` is a `CognitoConfig` is not gated on a user-pool session.
//! The page names the pool and app client the portal is configured with, because those are
//! stored facts, and serves the same public landing page it serves for the `None`
//! alternative; no sign-in is performed and no consumer identity is modelled, so nothing
//! here should be read as evidence that a portal's Cognito authorization keeps a visitor
//! out.

///   `/_aws/{portal-domain}/…` with the host itself. A client on the machine this emulator
