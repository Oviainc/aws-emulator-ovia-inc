//! End-to-end HTTP tests for the ApiGatewayV2 portal publication lifecycle —
//! `PublishPortal`, `DisablePortal` and `PreviewPortal`.
//!
//! The rules these cases assert:
//!
//! * **Each of the three calls only STARTS a build the service then carries out**: it
//!   answers its modelled success status with no body (202 for a publish and a preview,
//!   204 for a disable), the portal reports the `..._IN_PROGRESS` status of that build
//!   until the build's span has passed, and the status it settles in afterwards comes
//!   from the CLOCK — a later read reports it with nothing having been called in
//!   between.
//! * **A publish records the publication it made**: once settled, the portal reports the
//!   instant it published as `LastPublished` and the description the publish request
//!   carried as `LastPublishedDescription` ("When the portal is published, this
//!   description becomes the last published description"), and a republish replaces it.
//! * **A disable takes the publication down but not its history**: the portal reports
//!   `DISABLE_IN_PROGRESS` while the service removes the publication and settles in
//!   `DISABLED`, from where it serves nothing, and still reports the last publication
//!   there WAS. (That the portal's DOMAIN stops serving from the instant the disable is
//!   accepted, rather than when that status settles, is asserted in
//!   `portal_publication_revocation`; that a disable is accepted only from a status a
//!   publication can be taken down from, in `portal_terminal_lifecycle`.)
//! * **A preview changes nothing about what the portal publishes**: its `PublishStatus`
//!   is left exactly as it was, and the portal reports a `Preview` whose status moves
//!   from `PREVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` to `PREVIEW_READY` and whose URL names this portal —
//!   while a portal nothing has previewed reports the EMPTY preview.
//! * **A build starts only when what it needs is free**: a publish and a disable each
//!   need the portal's publication still, a publish and a preview each need its content
//!   build free, and a disable builds no content. So a preview and a disable run side by
//!   side while a publish runs alone. A build that cannot start is refused 409
//!   `ConflictException` and writes nothing, and the refusal lifts of its own accord once
//!   the build the service already owes comes due — unless what the first build left is a
//!   portal publishing nothing, which a second disable has nothing to take down from.
//! * **A portal is built only through its own minted id**: an id nothing minted is 404
//!   `NotFoundException` from all three calls.
//!
//! The rows vary what the rules generalise over: WHICH of the three builds runs first
//! and which runs second (every ordered pair of them), the publication the portal holds
//! when a build starts (one publish settled, two settled, a build still in flight), and
//! the description a publish carries (none, the empty string, a typical one, the maximum
//! 1024 characters the modelled `__stringMin0Max1024` allows, and one replacing an
//! earlier one).
