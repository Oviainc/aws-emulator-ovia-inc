//! Glue resource policies: `PutResourcePolicy`, `GetResourcePolicy`,
//! `DeleteResourcePolicy` and `GetResourcePolicies`.
//!
//! The rule under test: a resource policy is ONE record per Glue resource, addressed by
//! `ResourceArn` alone — this account's Data Catalog when the request names none — which a
//! put stores whole and re-hashes from the document it carries, a read reports with that
//! hash and the instants the attachment was created and last written, and a delete
//! removes. A resource carrying no policy is a miss for the read and the delete alike
//! (400 `EntityNotFoundException`, "Policy not found"), each condition a request carries
//! is checked BEFORE anything is stored, and `GetResourcePolicies` enumerates the
//! policies of individual resources without the account-level catalog policy among them.
//!
//! Each suite is a TABLE whose rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which
//! resource the policy is attached to, which document it carries (size, statement count,
//! ordering, spelling), which condition the request states, and how the page is cut. The
//! recorded case — a catalog policy put, read, conditionally rewritten and deleted — is
//! one row among them.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire through the shared [`crate::wire`] harness.
