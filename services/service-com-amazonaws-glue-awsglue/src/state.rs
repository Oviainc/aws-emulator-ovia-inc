//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-glue-awsglue service.
//!
//! The Data Catalog is the service's primary resource tree: a catalog (keyed by
//! `CatalogId`, which defaults to the request's account id) holds databases, and a
//! database holds tables. Every handler reads and writes THIS store, so a
//! `CreateTable` in one request is visible to a `GetTable` in the next.
//!
//! Crawlers sit BESIDE that tree, in one per-account namespace keyed by crawler name:
//! every operation that addresses a crawler does so by name alone, so a crawler's
//! `CatalogId` says where its output goes, not where the crawler itself lives.
//!
//! Database and table names are folded to lowercase on the way in — the model says
//! so for both `DatabaseInput$Name` ("For Hive compatibility, this is folded to
//! lowercase when it is stored") and `TableInput$Name` — and every lookup folds the
//! requested name the same way, so the fold cannot make a resource unreachable.
