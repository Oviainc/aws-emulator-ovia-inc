//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-account-account service.
//!
//! The account record is this service's primary resource: `PutAccountName`,
//! `PutAlternateContact` and `PutContactInformation` write it,
//! `GetAccountInformation`, `GetAlternateContact` and `GetContactInformation`
//! report it, and `DeleteAlternateContact` removes one of its contacts. The
//! record below is the one copy every one of those handlers reads and writes.
//! It also carries the account's most recent primary email update, which
//! `StartPrimaryEmailUpdate` records, `AcceptPrimaryEmailUpdate` confirms and
//! `GetPrimaryEmailUpdateStatus` reports, the primary email address every
//! account carries and a confirmed update replaces once it completed, which
//! `GetPrimaryEmail` reports, and the phone-number
//! verification of its primary contact, which `SendPhoneNumberVerification`
//! starts, `VerifyPhoneNumber` completes and `GetContactInformation` reports as
//! `VerificationStatus` ([`PhoneNumberVerification`]).
//!
//! Most Account Management operations take an OPTIONAL `AccountId`: absent, the
//! call lands on "the Amazon Web Services account of the identity used to call
//! the operation" — which for this emulator is
//! [`::emulator_server::emulator_account_id`]. Present, it names a MEMBER
//! account of the caller's organization, which the caller's own account is not:
//! that is [`target_account_id`], the one resolution every operation taking an
//! account id goes through. An operation that acts on an account which must
//! ALREADY exist refuses an id this emulator holds no record of in one place
//! too ([`ComAmazonawsAccountAccountState::accessible_account`], and
//! [`ComAmazonawsAccountAccountState::accessible_account_mut`] where the record
//! is then changed), and the COMPOSITION of the two —
//! [`ComAmazonawsAccountAccountState::target_account`] for a read,
//! [`ComAmazonawsAccountAccountState::target_account_mut`] for a write that
//! must not create a record — is what those handlers call, keeping only the
//! mapping into their own operation's error enum.
//!
//! The GovCloud slice hangs off that record too:
//! [`Account::gov_cloud_account`] holds the GovCloud account linked to the
//! standard account, which `GetGovCloudAccountInformation` reports. Creating a
//! GovCloud account is an Organizations operation and not one this service
//! binds, so the link is a fact the store HOLDS ([`GovCloudAccountLink`]),
//! never one a read derives and never one this emulator invents: no account
//! comes up linked, and a record carries a link only once something records
//! one through [`Account::link_gov_cloud_account`].
//!
//! The Region opt-in slice hangs off that same record:
//! [`Account::region_opt_status`] holds the opt status of every Region the
//! account has been opted into or out of, which `EnableRegion` and
//! `DisableRegion` write and `GetRegionOptStatus` and `ListRegions` report.
//! [`REGION_CATALOG`] is what decides whether a Region has an opt status at all
//! and what it reports before any opt call, and [`region_opt_target`] is the one
//! place that reads it to answer whether a Region can be the TARGET of an opt
//! call — the question `EnableRegion` and `DisableRegion` both decide by.
//!
//! The primary contact structure carries rules of the same kind, which the model
//! states in prose rather than in constraints: which two-letter strings are
//! country codes, and in which countries an address must carry a state or
//! region. [`validated_contact_information`] is the one place that decides both,
//! the question `PutContactInformation` admits a structure by.
