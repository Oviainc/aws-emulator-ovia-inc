//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-geomaps-mapsservice service: the map asset catalog.
//!
//! Geo Maps is a read-only content API — every operation it binds is
//! `@readonly` and there is no CRUD lifecycle — so this service's state is not
//! a resource table but an **asset catalog**: the style records, tilesets,
//! sprite sheets, font stacks, content types, cache directives and pricing
//! buckets that decide what each handler serves.
//!
//! The catalog is built by [`Default`], which is what `engine.state::<T>()`
//! calls the first time any handler touches this service's store. Seeding there
//! rather than from a handler is what keeps every operation a true read: no
//! request ever writes to this state, so what one caller sees is exactly what
//! the next one sees.
//!
//! Asset BYTES are not kept pre-rendered. Each handler derives them from the
//! catalog record plus the request's own addressing — tile coordinates, sprite
//! scale, glyph range, static-map framing — through [`assets`]. The derivation
//! is a pure function of (record, address), which gives the two properties a map
//! client needs: the same request always answers with byte-identical content and
//! therefore the same `ETag`, and changing a catalog record changes every asset
//! derived from it.
