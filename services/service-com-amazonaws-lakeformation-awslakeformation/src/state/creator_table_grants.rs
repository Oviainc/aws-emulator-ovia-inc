//! The grants a Data Catalog TABLE is created carrying, which no `GrantPermissions` call
//! made.
//!
//! Two of them, both made by the act of creating the table:
//!
//! * the principal that created it holds Super on it, with the grant option, so a listing
//!   of a table nobody has granted anything on still reports its creator;
//! * the default permissions its parent database hands the tables created in it
//!   (`Database$CreateTableDefaultPermissions` — "creates a set of default permissions on
//!   the table for principals. Used by Lake Formation") are held on the table by the
//!   principals that setting names.
//!
//! The database-level counterpart lives beside this module in `state.rs`
//! ([`super::default_database_grants`]), where the grant comes from the account's own data
//! lake settings.
//!
//! Like the database default, these grants are rendered per request from the Data Catalog
//! rather than written when the table is created, because this store never sees a table
//! being created: the Data Catalog is another service's state in the same shared engine
//! (see [`super::missing_grant_entity`] for that seam). Taking one away is the sibling
//! module `implicit_table_grants` ([`super::revoke_implicit_grants`]).
