//! The WORDS of the refusal the framework's boundary walk produces for this service: how a
//! set of constraint violations becomes the `message` a 400 `ValidationException` carries.
//!
//! [`crate::service`] owns the SEAM — which requests are checked, and how the violations and
//! the request's own values are collected — and this module owns the sentence, so the clause
//! rules live in one place instead of in each operation that trips them. What is ENFORCED is
//! always the model's: every violation handed to [`refusal`] comes from the framework's own
//! walk, and nothing here accepts or refuses anything.
//!
//! The rules, each holding for every member of every operation rather than for the members
//! one report happened to cite:
//!
//! 1. the envelope is AWS's, `<N> validation error(s) detected: ` over one clause per failing
//!    (member, requirement), joined with `; ` ([`envelope`]);
//! 2. a clause states the value as SUBMITTED, the member's dotted path and the requirement it
//!    failed, in the framework's own words ([`requirement`]);
//! 3. a reported `@pattern` is the expression without the `^`/`$` anchors a model writes to
//!    demand a whole-value match (`service_common::validation::unanchored`, the tree's one
//!    renderer of that rule);
//! 4. the echoed value is entity-escaped TWICE ([`entity_escaped_twice`]);
//! 5. a constraint broken by an ELEMENT of a collection is stated at the COLLECTION member,
//!    with no position and no `member` step: the value echoed is the whole collection the
//!    member held — the list the caller sent ([`collection_value`]) — and the element's
//!    requirement is nested inside `Member must satisfy constraint: [ … ]`. Two elements of
//!    one list that broke the same rule are therefore ONE clause, while a member that broke
//!    two rules still states both. A constraint broken by the list ITSELF (its own
//!    `@length`) is not nested, and neither is one broken by a member INSIDE a structure
//!    element, which keeps its own full path;
//! 6. an enumerated type's value SET is listed as the SERVICE states that enum, which is
//!    neither the order nor always the membership the model declares
//!    ([`stated_value_set`]); applied inside [`requirement`], so one enum reads alike
//!    whether its clause is stated at the enumerated member itself or nested inside one
//!    about the collection that holds it.
//!
//! The status (400) and the error code ([`VALIDATION_EXCEPTION`]) are what the framework
//! already answers a constraint failure with on this restJson1 service and are restated, not
//! changed: a chosen [`Refused`] replaces the code and the message together.
