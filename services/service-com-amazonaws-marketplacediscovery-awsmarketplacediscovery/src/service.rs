//! The `com-amazonaws-marketplacediscovery-awsmarketplacediscovery` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. This service returns the SAME operation the generated
//!   table names, wrapped in [`StatedPerOperation`] (see below).
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## This service's edited seams
//!
//! * [`authorization`] — the per-request IAM decision every operation takes before it reads
//!   any catalog record: `AccessDeniedException` is a service-common error of this model, so
//!   every operation has to be able to answer it.
//! * [`validation`] — the WORDS of a constraint refusal. Two parts of the sentence AWS
//!   states cannot be produced from the violations alone, which is all `override_refusal` is
//!   handed:
//!   - the value a clause echoes. The constraint walk stores it ELIDED (a bounded prefix
//!     plus a byte-count marker AWS never emits), because a clause interpolates whatever is
//!     stored and a caller controls the length; the submitted bytes are only recoverable
//!     from the built input.
//!   - the value a clause states at a COLLECTION member when one of its ELEMENTS failed.
//!     AWS reports such a failure at the collection and echoes the whole collection; the
//!     violation carries the one element.
//!
//!   [`StatedPerOperation`] is where both come from: every modelled operation is served
//!   wrapped in it, the wrapper asks `service_common::validation` for the framework's OWN
//!   violations against that operation's input schema — echoes restored — together with the
//!   request's own lists, and [`validation`] turns them into the sentence. `override_refusal`
//!   states a refusal that reaches the centralized walk anyway through the SAME module, so
//!   the wording lives in ONE place — it just has only the violations to state from.
