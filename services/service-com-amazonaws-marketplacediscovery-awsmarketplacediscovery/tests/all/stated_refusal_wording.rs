//! What a constraint refusal of this service STATES: the subject it quotes, the position it
//! names and the value set it lists.
//!
//! Three rules, each asserted over a TABLE that spans what the rule generalises over rather
//! than over the one request a report cited:
//!
//! 1. **A constraint an ELEMENT of a collection breaks is stated at the COLLECTION member.**
//!    The clause names the collection — no position, no `member` step — echoes the WHOLE
//!    list the caller sent, rendered `[<element>, …]`, and nests the element's requirement
//!    inside `Member must satisfy constraint: [ … ]`. A constraint the collection ITSELF
//!    breaks (its own `@length`) is not nested, and neither is one a member INSIDE a
//!    structure element breaks, which keeps its own full path.
//! 2. **A clause echoes the value the caller SUBMITTED, in full.** However long the value,
//!    the echo is the caller's own bytes with nothing elided and no marker appended: this
//!    message is the only place the server reports the offending input back.
//! 3. **An enum clause lists the value set as this SERVICE states it** — fixed text of the
//!    refusal, carrying nothing of the request, stated the same way at every member that
//!    enum constrains and on every operation. For `SearchFacetType` that set is not the
//!    model's at all: it carries a facet type the model's enum does not declare.
//!
//! Every request goes through the `MultiServiceRouter`, so the protocol, the routing table
//! and the framework's input walk are all exercised end to end.
