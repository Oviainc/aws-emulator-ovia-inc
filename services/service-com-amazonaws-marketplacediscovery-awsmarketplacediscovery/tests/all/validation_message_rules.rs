//! How this service STATES a constraint violation: the `ValidationException` report the
//! framework's input walk hands to `EmulatedService::override_refusal`.
//!
//! Two rules of how the report is BUILT are pinned here, over a table of inputs rather
//! than over one recorded request:
//!
//! 1. a `@pattern` clause reports the modeled expression with its `^` / `$` anchors
//!    stripped and everything between them verbatim — for EVERY member carrying a
//!    `@pattern`, at the top level and nested inside a list;
//! 2. the echoed value is entity-escaped TWICE, so a caller's `&`, `<` or `>` reaches
//!    the client as `&amp;amp;`, `&amp;lt;`, `&amp;gt;`.
//!
//! A constraint broken by a list ELEMENT is reported at the LIST member, echoing the whole
//! list and nesting the element's requirement inside `Member must satisfy constraint:
//! [ … ]` — the form `tests/all/stated_refusal_wording.rs` owns; the rows below that carry a
//! nested list are stated in that form.
//!
//! The suites around them pin what the two rules must NOT disturb: the error code
//! (`ValidationException`), the HTTP status (400), the `N validation error(s) detected:`
//! envelope, the member path, the `@length` / `@range` / enum clauses, and the bounds at
//! which a request is accepted rather than refused.
//!
//! Every request goes through the `MultiServiceRouter`, so the protocol, the routing
//! table and the framework's input walk are all exercised end to end.
