//! How this service WORDS a refusal: the three rules its `message` follows, each over a
//! table of requests rather than over one recorded call.
//!
//! For `restJson1` the `message` is the only human-readable part of a fault, so each of
//! these is as much a requirement as the status and the error code:
//!
//! 1. a `ResourceNotFoundException` names the resource the lookup was made by, spelled
//!    as the MODEL spells it (`offerSetId` -> `OfferSet`, the spelling of `OfferSetId` and
//!    `GetOfferSet`), never re-spelled as English prose;
//! 2. an enum clause lists the admissible value set in the order THIS SERVICE emits it,
//!    one fixed order per enum, the same wherever that set appears and independent of the
//!    request;
//! 3. a `searchText` carrying a newline is refused by this service's own sentence, which
//!    names the member and carries nothing else — no validation-report envelope, no echo
//!    of the submitted value and no regular expression.
//!
//! Every request goes through the `MultiServiceRouter`, so the protocol, the routing
//! table, the framework's input walk and the handlers are all exercised end to end.
