//! The AWS Artifact FRONT DOOR, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! AWS Artifact is not reached directly: it is served through a gateway that runs
//! before the service and answers in shapes this service's model does not declare. The
//! rule this suite pins, over the whole class of requests it covers rather than any one
//! of them:
//!
//! 1. **The targeted resource is authorized first.** A request that names a resource
//!    the gateway cannot authorize — an identifier that is not a well-formed id of its
//!    type, so it names nothing, or one the account's own catalog or inquiry set does not
//!    hold — is refused with HTTP 401 `UnauthorizedException`, ahead of the modelled
//!    member constraints and ahead of the service's own not-found. A target it CAN
//!    authorize is passed through to the operation, whatever the operation then answers.
//! 2. **The request body is validated next.** A body that does not bind to the
//!    modelled shape — a value outside an enum's set or a member's constraint, or a
//!    member the shape requires and the body omits — is refused with HTTP 400
//!    `BadRequestException`.
//! 3. **A value the URI carries is not the gateway's concern.** A `@httpQuery` or
//!    `@httpLabel` value outside its modelled constraint is refused by the SERVICE, as
//!    its modelled 400 `ValidationException` naming the member and the constraint.
//!
//! Each refusal carries the gateway's own constant text (`Unauthorized`, `Invalid
//! request body`): it names neither member nor constraint, because the gateway knows
//! only that it refused the call.
//!
//! Every assertion goes through the router, so each case exercises the same path a
//! client takes: routing, the front door, deserialization, validation and the handler.
