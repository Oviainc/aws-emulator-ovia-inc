//! The ONE rule every compliance-inquiry-targeting operation resolves its target by,
//! asserted over all four of them at once.
//!
//! A request naming a `complianceInquiryId` is resolved in one place, and what a caller
//! sees never depends on which operation asked:
//!
//! 1. the stored inquiry set IS the account's entitlement, so a well-formed `InquiryId`
//!    the account holds no inquiry for names no inquiry it may reach and is answered with
//!    the front door's 401 `UnauthorizedException` — the identical refusal, body included,
//!    whichever operation asked and whatever else the request carried;
//! 2. the inquiry the account DOES hold is served with the transition the clock already
//!    owed it applied, so the record every one of the four operations resolves past the
//!    due instant is the same one — and the instant it reports as last modified is the
//!    instant the transition fell DUE, not the instant that reader happened to call.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: which of the four operations drives the
//! resolution (the identifier is bound to the query string on two of them and to the
//! request body on the other two, and two of them go on to record against the inquiry),
//! the form of the submitted content (a typed query, an uploaded document, an upload
//! carrying no bytes at all), the support mode the submission asked for (absent, `AI_ONLY`,
//! `FULL_SUPPORT`) and therefore the terminal status the materialised record reports
//! (`COMPLETED`, `HUMAN_REVIEW`, `FAILED`), and — for the refusal — the alphabet and case
//! of the 16-character suffix the identifier pattern admits.
//!
//! Every case goes through the router, so each one exercises the same path a client takes:
//! routing, the front door, deserialization, the handler, the persisted state and
//! serialization. `ExportComplianceInquiry` is read through the document its own answer
//! announces, which the handler renders off the record it resolved, so what that operation
//! resolved is observable in its own answer rather than in a later read.
