//! The `com-amazonaws-artifact-artifact` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. Return `Some(op)` to route one yourself.
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## The front door
//!
//! AWS Artifact is not reached directly: it is served through a gateway that, BEFORE
//! the service runs,
//!
//! 1. authorizes the resource the request targets, and refuses a target it cannot
//!    authorize with HTTP 401 `UnauthorizedException`; and
//! 2. validates the request BODY against the modelled shape, and refuses a body it
//!    cannot bind with HTTP 400 `BadRequestException`.
//!
//! Neither shape is in this service's model — the gateway answers before the service
//! is reached, so it answers in its own shapes — and neither refusal is a modelled
//! error: a caller sees `UnauthorizedException` where the service itself would have
//! said `ResourceNotFoundException`, and `BadRequestException` where it would have
//! said `ValidationException`. Values the request carries in its URI are NOT the
//! gateway's concern: a `@httpQuery` or `@httpLabel` value outside its modelled
//! constraint is refused by THIS service, as its modelled 400 `ValidationException` —
//! the whole shape, `reason` and `fieldList` included, not a message on its own.
//!
//! [`EmulatedService::examine`] is those three judgements for every request this service serves, reached
//! through [`Service::override_operation`] because all of them precede the modelled walk:
//! constraint validation runs before a handler, so a handler cannot answer ahead of it.
//! The framework's own boundary refusal cannot carry the modelled shape (the seam it
//! offers chooses an error code and a message, and nothing else), so a request whose
//! URI-bound value the model's constraints refuse is answered HERE, by
//! [`ConstraintRefusal`], in the one envelope `crate::state` words every such refusal in.
//! `override_refusal` below stays as the wording of anything that still reaches that
//! boundary. The one judgement the gateway cannot make here is whether a well-formed
//! identifier names a resource the account holds — that is this service's state — so each
//! report handler makes it, through `crate::scaffolded::Scaffolded::unauthorized`, and
//! answers the same 401.
//!
//! All three are judgements about ONE operation's input, so each needs the operation the
//! request addresses. The protocol names it for every request that carries what its route
//! needs; a request that leaves a `@required` `@httpQuery` member out matches no route at
//! all, and it still addressed the operation its method and path address, so
//! [`addresses`] reads the name off the input schema's own `@http` binding for that one.
//! Without it such a request would never be judged and would be answered as an operation
//! this emulator does not serve — which is not what it was, whatever it then deserves.
//!
//! ## The document plane
//!
//! `ExportComplianceInquiry` hands out a PRESIGNED URL, and a presigned URL is a promise
//! that a caller can follow it: it names the endpoint the CALLER reached this emulator on
//! (`crate::state::document_url_host`), under the path
//! `crate::state::EXPORT_DOCUMENT_PATH_PREFIX` owns, which names no modelled operation.
//! Two seams carry it, the same pair any emulated data plane uses:
//!
//! - [`Service::can_handle`] also claims a request to a path this service publishes its
//!   exports at, so a fetch that carries neither a credential nor a host naming a service
//!   — which is every fetch of a URL this service handed out — is not answered
//!   `UnknownService`;
//! - [`Service::override_routing_error`] serves it. A document request names no modelled
//!   operation by construction, so the router reaches exactly this seam for it, and
//!   reaches it BEFORE authentication — which is what lets a presigned URL be followed
//!   without a signature, as a presigned URL is.
//!
//! What it serves is the document the export STORED
//! (`crate::state::InquiryExport::document`), rendered from the inquiry when the export
//! ran: a download is a pure read, and a URL whose export has since been released, or
//! that names another inquiry or another object, serves no document. The fetch is
//! authorised by the download token the announced URL carries
//! (`crate::state::InquiryExport::download_token`), the ONE thing a caller that was handed
//! the URL holds — the ids its path carries are minted from counters, so they authorise
//! nobody — and a fetch presenting no such token is refused `403`, as the report plane
//! below refuses a fetch carrying no term grant.
//!
//! The REPORT and TERM documents `GetReport` and `GetTermForReport` hand out are served
//! the same way, by [`Documents`] under `crate::state::DOCUMENT_PATH_PREFIX`: their bytes
//! are PERSISTED beside the catalog record they belong to (`crate::state::Document`), so
//! the URL those operations announce resolves to a document this service holds rather
//! than to a dead locator. What the page says is the stored record and that the emulator
//! published it — an AWS report's own contents are AWS's and are not invented here. That
//! URL names the endpoint the CALLER reached this emulator on
//! (`crate::state::document_url_host`), because this emulator is what serves it. That
//! plane is authorised by the SAME kind of receipt: the term grant's `termToken`
//! (`crate::state::TermGrant::token`), minted per acceptance from no counter, is the one
//! thing a caller that accepted the term holds, so a fetch of a gated document presenting
//! anything derivable is refused `403` too.
