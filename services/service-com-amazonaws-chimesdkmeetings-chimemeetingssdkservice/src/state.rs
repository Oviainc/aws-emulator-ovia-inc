//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-chimesdkmeetings-chimemeetingssdkservice service.
//!
//! The meeting is this service's primary resource and its attendees live INSIDE it, so
//! `CreateMeeting`, `GetMeeting`, `DeleteMeeting`, `CreateAttendee`, `GetAttendee`,
//! `ListAttendees` and `DeleteAttendee` all read and write the one [`StoredMeeting`] map
//! held here. Nesting the attendees under their meeting is what makes
//! `DeleteMeeting` remove them transitively and makes it impossible for
//! `ListAttendees`/`GetAttendee` to reach another meeting's attendees.
//!
//! The derivations beside the map — the GUID minting, the `MediaPlacement` endpoints, the
//! ARN, the documented capability defaults and the documented attendee ceiling — live
//! here rather than in a handler because several operation files share them, and a second
//! copy of any of them would let two operations disagree about one meeting.
//!
//! # Every store here is bounded
//!
//! This process authenticates nobody, so a caller that reaches it must not be able to
//! grow its memory without limit:
//!
//! | store | ceiling | release |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`ComAmazonawsChimesdkmeetingsChimemeetingssdkserviceState::meetings`] | [`MAX_MEETINGS`] | `DeleteMeeting`, or `CreateMeeting` is refused |
//! | [`StoredMeeting::attendees`] | [`attendee_ceiling`] per meeting | `DeleteAttendee`/`DeleteMeeting`, or `CreateAttendee` is refused |
//! | [`ComAmazonawsChimesdkmeetingsChimemeetingssdkserviceState::meeting_by_client_request_token`] | one entry per live meeting | the entry is dropped with its meeting |
//! | the record of ended meetings | [`MAX_ENDED_MEETINGS`] | the oldest id is forgotten when the next meeting ends |
//!
//! One thing this service reads is NOT in the struct below, because the other Chime
//! services read and write it too and the engine keys state by type: the family's
//! ARN-keyed TAG directory ([`chime_tags`]), which holds the tags of every meeting —
//! including the ones a create was given.
