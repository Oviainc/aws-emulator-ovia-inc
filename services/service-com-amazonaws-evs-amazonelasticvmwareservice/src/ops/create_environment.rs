//! @op CreateEnvironment
//! Mints an environment and persists it in [`crate::state`]: a new `environmentId`,
//! its ARN, `environmentState` `CREATING` (the clock owes it `CREATED`), and the ten
//! VLAN subnets materialised from `initialVlans`. Every other operation of this
//! service reads what this one stored.
//!
//! Those ten VLAN subnets are PROVISIONED, not just recorded: "Amazon EVS provisions
//! only the VLAN subnets" in `SELF_DEPLOYED` mode and provisions them plus VCF
//! otherwise, and they are subnets of the caller's own VPC — so each is created in the
//! account's Amazon EC2 store through EC2's own writer
//! ([`crate::state::ec2_resources::provision_vlan_subnets`]), and the `Vlan` reports
//! the `subnetId` and `availabilityZone` of the subnet EC2 holds.
//!
//! The `hosts` the request carries are MATERIALISED the same way, not merely recorded:
//! they are "The ESX hosts to add to the environment" (`hosts` doc) and "When you
//! specify any other VCF version, Amazon EVS installs and configures VCF for you" (this
//! operation's doc), so each entry becomes a host of the environment exactly as
//! `CreateEnvironmentHost` adds one — a `Host` record `ListEnvironmentHosts` reports,
//! `HostState` `CREATING` with the move to `CREATED` the clock owes it, a management
//! address out of the environment's own `vmkManagement` VLAN subnet, the EC2 bare metal
//! instance an ESX host IS ([`crate::state::ec2_resources::launch_host_instance`]), and
//! the default ESX version of the environment's VCF version ("When Amazon EVS installs
//! VCF, the default ESX version for the selected VCF version will be used"), since no
//! member of this request names one. `SELF_DEPLOYED` is the one mode that adds none:
//! "no hosts are added and no VCF installation is performed. After the environment is
//! created, you can add hosts with CreateEnvironmentHost".
//!
//! The request-level rules it enforces beyond the modelled constraints, each from the
//! documentation quoted under "Modeled contract" below:
//!
//! 1. `dedicatedHostId` and `placementGroupId` cannot be used together in one
//!    `HostInfoForCreate`.
//! 2. A VLAN subnet CIDR block is between /24 and /28, and no two of an
//!    environment's VLAN subnets may overlap. A VLAN subnet Amazon EVS provisions
//!    PUBLIC is narrowed further, to exactly a /28: "If you plan to use a public HCX
//!    VLAN subnet, the following requirements must be met: Must have a /28 netmask"
//!    (`InitialVlans$hcx` doc) — the extra requirement the public case carries, which
//!    the general range alone would admit a larger block for. The other requirements
//!    of that same list (the block allocated from the account's public IPAM pool, added
//!    to the VPC as a secondary CIDR block, and two Elastic IP addresses allocated from
//!    that pool) name no member of this request, so this operation has nothing to
//!    decide them from and refuses nothing for them.
//! 3. `hcxNetworkAclId` is required when `isHcxPublic` is true.
//! 4. An environment name is unique within the account and Region.
//! 5. `termsAccepted` must be true: it is the caller's confirmation that it holds the
//!    VCF licenses the environment needs, so an environment cannot be created without
//!    it.
//! 6. The `vpcId` is not already used by another deployed environment of this Region.
//! 7. The `vpcId` names a VPC the account holds, and the `serviceAccessSubnetId` a
//!    subnet of THAT VPC: an environment is deployed into the caller's existing
//!    network, so a request naming a VPC or subnet that does not exist is refused with
//!    a clause naming the id it gave ([`crate::state::ec2_resources`], which reads
//!    Amazon EC2's own store).
//! 8. Each VLAN subnet CIDR block is a block of that VPC's own address space and
//!    overlaps no subnet the VPC already holds: "Amazon EVS VLAN subnet CIDR blocks
//!    must not overlap with other subnets in the VPC" (`InitialVlans` doc) — rule 2 at
//!    the scope the doc states it, which is what lets each block become a real subnet
//!    of the VPC.
//! 9. A `placementGroupId` or `dedicatedHostId` an entry of `hosts` names resolves in
//!    that same EC2 store: a host is PLACED on those resources and Amazon EVS creates
//!    neither, so they are the caller's own, judged exactly as rule 7 judges the
//!    network ([`crate::state::ec2_resources::host_placement_failures`]). An entry
//!    refused by rule 1 names both mechanisms, so neither of its references is resolved.
//! 10. A `hostName` an entry of `hosts` names is free: "DNS hostnames for hosts must be
//!    unique across Amazon EVS environments and within VCF"
//!    (`HostInfoForCreate$hostName` doc), and the hosts this create adds TAKE their
//!    names — so a name a host of some environment already carries, or a name the
//!    request gives twice, names a host that cannot be added. The rule
//!    `CreateEnvironmentHost` applies to its single `host`, at the scope the doc states
//!    it, and judged only where the request's VCF version adds the hosts at all, because
//!    a mode that adds none takes no name. Two names are one name when they differ only
//!    in case, because a DNS name is case-insensitive
//!    ([`crate::state::same_dns_name`]).
//! 11. No `tags` key claims the reserved `aws:` namespace
//!    ([`crate::state::RESERVED_TAG_KEY_PREFIX`]): that namespace is Amazon Web
//!    Services' own, so a caller cannot create a tag in it — the same reservation
//!    `TagResource` and `UntagResource` enforce, applied here because this operation
//!    writes the request's tags onto the environment it mints.
//! 12. No two members of `vcfHostnames` carry the same DNS hostname: "Each hostname
//!    must be unique" (`VcfHostnames` doc), because the nine members name nine
//!    separate VCF management appliances and a hostname resolves to one of them — so a
//!    hostname a member before it already claimed names an appliance that cannot be
//!    installed, and that member is refused. Judged only where Amazon EVS INSTALLS
//!    VCF, exactly as rule 10 is: a mode that installs no appliance claims no hostname.
//!    "The same" is read as rule 10 reads it, ignoring case.
//! 13. Each `serviceAccessSecurityGroups.securityGroups` entry names a security group
//!    the account holds IN that same VPC: those groups "allow traffic between the Amazon
//!    EVS control plane and your VPC for Amazon EVS service access"
//!    (`ServiceAccessSecurityGroups` doc) and Amazon EVS creates none of them, and a
//!    security group belongs to one VPC — rule 7 for the one other member of this
//!    request that names an existing EC2 resource of the caller's network
//!    ([`crate::state::ec2_resources::security_group_failures`]).
//! 14. Each `connectivityInfo.privateRouteServerPeerings` entry names a route server peer
//!    the account holds: they are "The unique IDs for private route server peers" and
//!    "during environment creation, the route server endpoints peer with the NSX uplink
//!    VLAN" (`ConnectivityInfo` docs), so each id names an Amazon EC2 resource of the
//!    caller's own account that Amazon EVS does not create — rule 7 for one more member
//!    naming an existing EC2 resource, asked of the same store
//!    ([`crate::state::ec2_resources::route_server_peer_failures`]). Judged only where
//!    Amazon EVS INSTALLS VCF, exactly as rules 10 and 12 are, because that peering is
//!    part of the installation and the member is "Not supported when `vcfVersion` is
//!    `SELF_DEPLOYED`".
//!
//! 15. The `initialVlans.hcxNetworkAclId` a request carries names a network access
//!    control list the account holds IN that same VPC: it is "A unique ID for a network
//!    access control list that the HCX VLAN uses" (`InitialVlans$hcxNetworkAclId` doc) —
//!    an Amazon EC2 resource of the caller's own account, which Amazon EVS does not
//!    create — and a network ACL belongs to one VPC, so it is judged exactly as rule 13
//!    judges the service access security groups, from the same store
//!    ([`crate::state::ec2_resources::network_acl_failures`]). Judged wherever the member
//!    is SUPPLIED, public HCX VLAN or not, because the id is stored on the HCX VLAN and
//!    reported back as `Vlan$networkAclId` either way.
//!
//! Supplying a parameter the chosen VCF mode does not support is NOT one of them.
//! `SELF_DEPLOYED` "does not support" `licenseInfo`, `hosts`, `vcfHostnames`, `siteId`
//! and `connectivityInfo` in the sense that it does nothing with them — no hosts are
//! added and no VCF is installed in that mode — and the recorded wire confirms that a
//! request carrying all five of them together with `vcfVersion` `SELF_DEPLOYED` is NOT
//! refused for carrying them: the refusal it drew named the VPC and nothing else. The
//! members are therefore accepted and stored as supplied, exactly as `clientToken` is
//! ("If you supply input for this parameter, it will have no effect").
//!
//! The account's AWS Premium Support subscription is not a precondition either: this
//! emulator holds no account-subscription state to decide it from, and a guess either
//! way would refuse or admit every request alike. Only preconditions this service can
//! actually evaluate are enforced.
//!
//! Every one of those checks runs before anything is minted, and they are all
//! evaluated: a request that breaks several is refused ONCE, with one
//! `ValidationException` whose `fieldList` carries an entry per failed check and whose
//! `message` joins those entries ([`crate::state::aggregate_validation_error`]). A
//! refused request creates nothing.
//!
//! The store itself is bounded by [`crate::state::MAX_ENVIRONMENTS`]: this is the only
//! operation that grows it, and it refuses with the service's
//! `ServiceQuotaExceededException` once the cap is reached and no finished (`DELETED`)
//! record can be reclaimed.
//!
//! ## Shape of an operation
//!
//! Each operation is a struct that owns the shared engine and implements
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::Operation`]. The framework constructs one per service via
//! `CreateEnvironment::new(engine)` and drives it through the centralized request walk:
//! deserialize → validate → `handle` → serialize. You write ONLY the `handle` body.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the guard it hands back:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!     let state = crate::state::service_state(&*self.engine)
//!         .ok_or(/* a modelled server error */)?;
//!     state.lock().your_field = /* ... */;
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//! The engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! @generated by the emulator core scaffold op-stub generator.
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!

//!
//! # Modeled contract for `CreateEnvironment`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-evs-amazonelasticvmwareservice/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-evs-amazonelasticvmwareservice.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Creates an Amazon EVS environment that runs VCF software, such as SDDC Manager, NSX
//! Manager, and vCenter Server. When you specify SELF_DEPLOYED for vcfVersion, Amazon EVS
//! provisions only the VLAN subnets; no hosts are added and no VCF installation is
//! performed. After the environment is created, you can add hosts with
//! CreateEnvironmentHost and install VCF yourself. The licenseInfo, hosts, vcfHostnames,
//! siteId, and connectivityInfo parameters are not supported in this mode. When you specify
//! any other VCF version, Amazon EVS installs and configures VCF for you. For more
//! information, see Self-deployed mode in the Amazon EVS User Guide. When Amazon EVS
//! installs VCF, the default ESX version for the selected VCF version will be used. After a
//! host is added with a specific ESX version, it can only be upgraded using vCenter
//! Lifecycle Manager. You cannot use the dedicatedHostId and placementGroupId parameters
//! together in the same CreateEnvironment action. This results in a ValidationException
//! response.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `clientToken` (ClientToken, len 1..100, pattern ^[!-~]+$, @idempotencyToken) — This
//!   parameter is not used in Amazon EVS currently. If you supply input for this parameter,
//!   it will have no effect. A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
//!   the idempotency of the environment creation request. If you do not specify a client
//!   token, a randomly generated token is used for the request to ensure idempotency.
//! * `connectivityInfo` (ConnectivityInfo) — The connectivity configuration for the
//!   environment. Amazon EVS requires that you specify two route server peer IDs. During
//!   environment creation, the route server endpoints peer with the NSX edges over the NSX
//!   uplink subnet, providing BGP-based dynamic routing for overlay networks. Not supported
//!   when vcfVersion is SELF_DEPLOYED.
//! * `environmentName` (EnvironmentName, len 1..100, pattern ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$) — The name to
//!   give to your environment. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters
//!   (case-sensitive), hyphens, and underscores. It must start with an alphanumeric
//!   character, and can't be longer than 100 characters. The name must be unique within the
//!   Amazon Web Services Region and Amazon Web Services account that you're creating the
//!   environment in.
//! * `hosts` (HostInfoForCreateList, len 4..4) — The ESX hosts to add to the environment. For
//!   each host, provide the desired hostname, EC2 SSH keypair name, and EC2 instance type.
//!   Optionally, provide a partition or cluster placement group, or use Amazon EC2 Dedicated
//!   Hosts. Not supported when vcfVersion is SELF_DEPLOYED. In that case, you can add hosts
//!   using CreateEnvironmentHost after the environment is created.
//! * `initialVlans` (InitialVlans) **required** — The initial VLAN subnets for the Amazon EVS
//!   environment. For each Amazon EVS VLAN subnet, you must specify a non-overlapping CIDR
//!   block. Amazon EVS VLAN subnets have a minimum CIDR block size of /28 and a maximum size
//!   of /24.
//! * `kmsKeyId` (String) — A unique ID for the customer-managed KMS key that is used to
//!   encrypt the VCF credential pairs for SDDC Manager, NSX Manager, and vCenter appliances.
//!   These credentials are stored in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.
//! * `licenseInfo` (LicenseInfoList, len 1..1) — The license information that Amazon EVS
//!   requires to create an environment. Amazon EVS requires two license keys: a VCF solution
//!   key and a vSAN license key. The VCF solution key must meet minimum core requirements,
//!   and the vSAN license key must meet minimum capacity requirements for your selected
//!   instance type. For information about minimum license requirements, see the VCF
//!   subscriptions section in the Amazon EVS User Guide. VCF licenses can be used for only
//!   one Amazon EVS environment. Amazon EVS does not support reuse of VCF licenses for
//!   multiple environments. VCF license information can be retrieved from the Broadcom
//!   portal. Not supported when vcfVersion is SELF_DEPLOYED.
//! * `serviceAccessSecurityGroups` (ServiceAccessSecurityGroups) — The security group that
//!   controls communication between the Amazon EVS control plane and VPC. The default
//!   security group is used if a custom security group isn't specified. The security group
//!   should allow access to the following. TCP/UDP access to the DNS servers HTTPS/SSH access
//!   to the host management VLAN subnet HTTPS/SSH access to the Management VM VLAN subnet You
//!   should avoid modifying the security group rules after deployment, as this can break the
//!   persistent connection between the Amazon EVS control plane and VPC. This can cause
//!   future environment actions like adding or removing hosts to fail.
//! * `serviceAccessSubnetId` (SubnetId, len 15..24, pattern
//!   ^subnet-[a-f0-9]{8}([a-f0-9]{9})?$) **required** — The subnet that is used to establish
//!   connectivity between the Amazon EVS control plane and VPC. The Amazon EVS control plane
//!   uses this subnet to interface with your environment. This includes validating DNS
//!   records and enabling Amazon EVS Connectors.
//! * `siteId` (String) — The Broadcom Site ID that is allocated to you as part of your
//!   electronic software delivery. This ID allows customer access to the Broadcom portal, and
//!   is provided to you by Broadcom at the close of your software contract or contract
//!   renewal. Amazon EVS uses the Broadcom Site ID that you provide to meet Broadcom VCF
//!   license usage reporting requirements for Amazon EVS. Not supported when vcfVersion is
//!   SELF_DEPLOYED.
//! * `tags` (RequestTagMap, len 1..200) — Metadata that assists with categorization and
//!   organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags
//!   don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.
//! * `termsAccepted` (Boolean) **required** — Confirmation that the customer has purchased
//!   and will continue to maintain the required number of VCF software licenses to cover all
//!   physical processor cores in the Amazon EVS environment. Information about your VCF
//!   software in Amazon EVS will be shared with Broadcom to verify license compliance. Amazon
//!   EVS does not validate license keys. To validate license keys, visit the Broadcom support
//!   portal.
//! * `vcfHostnames` (VcfHostnames) — The DNS hostnames for the virtual machines that host the
//!   VCF management appliances. Provide hostnames for vCenter, NSX Manager, SDDC Manager, and
//!   Cloud Builder. Not supported when vcfVersion is SELF_DEPLOYED.
//! * `vcfVersion` (VcfVersion, one of: SELF_DEPLOYED | VCF-5.2.1 | VCF-5.2.2) **required** —
//!   The VCF version to use for the environment. SELF_DEPLOYED: You install VCF yourself. The
//!   licenseInfo, hosts, vcfHostnames, siteId, and connectivityInfo parameters are not
//!   supported. Any other valid value: Amazon EVS installs and configures VCF for you in the
//!   version you specify.
//! * `vpcId` (VpcId, len 12..21, pattern ^vpc-[a-f0-9]{8}([a-f0-9]{9})?$) **required** — A
//!   unique ID for the VPC that the environment is deployed inside. Amazon EVS requires that
//!   all VPC subnets exist in a single Availability Zone in a Region where the service is
//!   available. The VPC that you specify must have a valid DHCP option set with domain name,
//!   at least two DNS servers, and an NTP server. These settings are used to configure your
//!   VCF appliances and hosts. The VPC cannot be used with any other deployed Amazon EVS
//!   environment. Amazon EVS does not provide multi-VPC support for environments at this
//!   time. Amazon EVS does not support the following Amazon Web Services networking options
//!   for NSX overlay connectivity: cross-Region VPC peering, Amazon S3 gateway endpoints, or
//!   Amazon …
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `environment` (Environment) — A description of the created environment.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — The input fails to satisfy the specified constraints.
//!   You will see this exception if invalid inputs are provided for any of the Amazon EVS
//!   environment operations, or if a list operation is performed on an environment resource
//!   that is still initializing.
