//! @op CreateEnvironmentHost
//! Adds an ESX host to a stored environment and persists it in [`crate::state`]: the
//! host name, key and instance type the request gave, a management IP address taken
//! out of the environment's own `vmkManagement` VLAN subnet, and `HostState`
//! `CREATING` (the clock owes it `CREATED`). `ListEnvironmentHosts` reports what this
//! operation stored.
//!
//! An Amazon EVS host IS an EC2 bare metal instance — "An ESX host that runs on an
//! Amazon EC2 bare metal instance" (`Host` doc) — so this operation also LAUNCHES that
//! instance into the account's own Amazon EC2 store, from the `keyName` and
//! `instanceType` the request gave, in the environment's `vmkManagement` VLAN subnet and
//! on its management address, and attaches the two ENIs Amazon EVS gives a host
//! (`NetworkInterface` doc). The host reports that instance's id as `ec2InstanceId` and
//! those interfaces as `networkInterfaces`, so a caller can look the host's instance up
//! with EC2's own `DescribeInstances`. The launch happens after every precondition below
//! has passed, so a refused request launches nothing; an EC2 store this emulator cannot
//! reach leaves both members absent rather than naming resources that do not exist
//! ([`crate::state::ec2_resources::launch_host_instance`]).
//!
//! The rules it enforces, each from the documentation quoted under "Modeled contract"
//! below. This operation's error contract is `ThrottlingException` and
//! `ValidationException` ONLY — it declares no `ResourceNotFoundException` — so a
//! well-formed `environmentId` that names no environment is refused with the
//! `ValidationException` that names it ([`crate::state::environment_not_found_validation`]):
//!
//! 1. The `environmentId` names an environment this service holds, in the Region the
//!    request was addressed to. Refused on its own, because a request against an
//!    environment that is not there has nothing further to judge.
//! 2. "This action can only be used after the Amazon EVS environment is deployed": an
//!    environment that has not reached `CREATED` cannot take a host yet.
//! 3. "You cannot use the `dedicatedHostId` and `placementGroupId` parameters together
//!    in the same `CreateEnvironmentHost` action" — the `HostInfoForCreate` shape's own
//!    rule, refused through the one helper `CreateEnvironment` uses for it.
//! 4. "DNS hostnames for hosts must be unique across Amazon EVS environments and
//!    within VCF" (`hostName` doc). A DNS name is case-insensitive, so a name a host
//!    already carries is taken in every spelling of it
//!    ([`crate::state::same_dns_name`]).
//! 5. The environment's `vmkManagement` VLAN subnet has an address left for the host:
//!    an ESX host's management interface lives on that VLAN, so that subnet's usable
//!    range is what bounds how many hosts one environment can hold.
//! 6. The EC2 resources the host is PLACED on exist in the account's own Amazon EC2
//!    store: `placementGroupId` is "the unique ID of the placement group where the host
//!    is placed" and `dedicatedHostId` "the unique ID of the Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host",
//!    and Amazon EVS creates neither, so a host that names one names a resource the
//!    account already holds ([`crate::state::ec2_resources::host_placement_failures`]) —
//!    the rule `CreateEnvironment` already applies to an environment's `vpcId` and
//!    `serviceAccessSubnetId`. A host that names BOTH mechanisms is refused by rule 3
//!    alone, so neither reference is resolved for it.
//! 7. An `esxVersion` the request names is one of the versions Amazon EVS offers for the
//!    environment's VCF version: "To find the available ESX versions for a particular VCF
//!    version, use the GetVersions action", so the catalogue that action reports
//!    ([`crate::state::available_esx_versions`]) is what an asked-for version has to be
//!    in. A VCF version that catalogue states no versions for leaves nothing to judge a
//!    requested version against, so nothing is refused for it.
//!
//! Rules 2 to 7 are evaluated together, so a request that breaks several is refused
//! ONCE with one `ValidationException` whose `fieldList` carries an entry per failure —
//! the shape `CreateEnvironment` answers with. A refused request adds nothing.
//!
//! `keyName` is the one member of a host naming an EC2 resource that is NOT resolved:
//! the account's Amazon EC2 store holds no key pairs at all — every `…KeyPair` operation
//! of that service is still a scaffold stub, so nothing can put one there — and a store
//! that holds no records of a kind is no evidence about any one name, the same reading
//! this service takes of an EC2 store it cannot read at all.
//!
//! `esxVersion` is stored as the version the host RUNS: the one the request named, or
//! — when it named none — the default ESX version the service's own version catalogue
//! gives the environment's VCF version ([`crate::state::default_esx_version`], the
//! catalogue `GetVersions` reports). It is reported by nothing, because the modelled
//! `Host` shape carries no ESX version member.
//!
//! ## Shape of an operation
//!
//! Each operation is a struct that owns the shared engine and implements
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::Operation`]. The framework constructs one per service via
//! `CreateEnvironmentHost::new(engine)` and drives it through the centralized request walk:
//! deserialize → validate → `handle` → serialize. You write ONLY the `handle` body.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the guard it hands back:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!     let state = crate::state::service_state(&*self.engine)
//!         .ok_or(/* a modelled server error */)?;
//!     state.lock().your_field = /* ... */;
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//! The engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! @generated by the emulator core scaffold op-stub generator.
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `CreateEnvironmentHost`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-evs-amazonelasticvmwareservice/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-evs-amazonelasticvmwareservice.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Creates an ESX host and adds it to an Amazon EVS environment. This action can only be
//! used after the Amazon EVS environment is deployed. You can use the dedicatedHostId
//! parameter to specify an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host for ESX host creation. You can use the
//! placementGroupId parameter to specify a cluster or partition placement group to launch
//! EC2 instances into. If you don't specify an ESX version when adding hosts using
//! CreateEnvironmentHost action, Amazon EVS automatically uses the default ESX version for
//! your environment's VCF version. To find the available ESX versions for a particular VCF
//! version, use the GetVersions action. You cannot use the dedicatedHostId and
//! placementGroupId parameters together in the same CreateEnvironmentHost action. This
//! results in a ValidationException response.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `clientToken` (ClientToken, len 1..100, pattern ^[!-~]+$, @idempotencyToken) — This
//!   parameter is not used in Amazon EVS currently. If you supply input for this parameter,
//!   it will have no effect. A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
//!   the idempotency of the host creation request. If you do not specify a client token, a
//!   randomly generated token is used for the request to ensure idempotency.
//! * `environmentId` (EnvironmentId, pattern ^(env-[a-zA-Z0-9]{10})$) **required** — A unique
//!   ID for the environment that the host is added to.
//! * `esxVersion` (EsxVersion, len ..128) — The ESX version to use for the host.
//! * `host` (HostInfoForCreate) **required** — The host that is created and added to the
//!   environment.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `environmentSummary` (EnvironmentSummary) — A summary of the environment that the host
//!   is created in.
//! * `host` (Host) — A description of the created host.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `ThrottlingException` (HTTP 429) — The operation could not be performed because the
//!   service is throttling requests. This exception is thrown when the service endpoint
//!   receives too many concurrent requests.
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — The input fails to satisfy the specified constraints.
//!   You will see this exception if invalid inputs are provided for any of the Amazon EVS
//!   environment operations, or if a list operation is performed on an environment resource
//!   that is still initializing.
