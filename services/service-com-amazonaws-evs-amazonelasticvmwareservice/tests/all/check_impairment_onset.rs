//! When an environment health check's impairment is dated from, end to end over
//! awsJson1_0.
//!
//! THE RULE under test: `Check$impairedSince` is "the time when environment health began
//! to be impaired" (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="Check")`), so a FAILED check is
//! dated from the latest instant a fact THAT check reads was changed — including a fact
//! that is not part of the environment's own record. A check cannot have begun failing
//! before the fact that makes it fail was written.
//!
//! Two of the checks this service decides read exactly such a fact
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="CheckType")`):
//!
//! * `KEY_COVERAGE` — "Verifies that the VCF license key allocates sufficient vCPU cores
//!   for all deployed hosts": the cores to allocate are the account's own
//!   `vcfPortedCoreCount` setting ("The total number of VCF license cores ported to
//!   Amazon EVS for the account in that Region", `AccountSetting$name` doc), which lives
//!   in the account's settings and in no environment. So an impairment a
//!   `PutAccountSettings` caused is dated from that put, not from the environment's own
//!   last modification.
//! * `KEY_REUSE` — "Verifies that the VCF license key is not used by another Amazon EVS
//!   environment": the other environments' license keys. So an impairment another
//!   environment caused by taking the same key is dated from the instant that
//!   environment took it, which is after the impaired environment's own stamp whenever it
//!   was created later.
//!
//! The rows of the tables differ along what the rule generalises over: for the account
//! setting, the core count written, the instance type the hosts run on (and so the cores
//! the licenses have to cover), and whether a passing count was stated before the
//! impairing one; for the shared key, which member of `licenseInfo` carries the key the
//! two environments share.
//!
//! The suites that own the neighbouring rules: `environment_health_checks.rs` owns which
//! checks a settled environment reports and that an onset does not move while the check
//! keeps failing, and `environment_check_input_recompute.rs` owns that a call changing a
//! check input recomputes the results.
//!
//! The harness (`emulator`, `call`, `error_type`) is the one `environment_lifecycle`
//! owns, so every test drives the service the way a client does.
