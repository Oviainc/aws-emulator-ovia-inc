//! The ten VLAN subnets `CreateEnvironment` provisions are REAL subnets of the
//! caller's VPC, in the account's own Amazon EC2 store.
//!
//! The rule under test, one level above the example: a resource a service PROVISIONS in
//! another service's namespace is created in that other service's own store, so every
//! service reads the same resource, and it is removed from that store when the resource
//! that provisioned it is deleted. For Amazon EVS: "Amazon EVS provisions only the VLAN
//! subnets" when `vcfVersion` is `SELF_DEPLOYED` and provisions them plus VCF
//! otherwise, each inside the VPC the request names, and "environment deletion also
//! deletes the associated Amazon EVS VLAN subnets" (`CreateEnvironment` /
//! `DeleteEnvironment` docs). So, for every VLAN the environment reports:
//!
//! * `ec2 DescribeSubnets` finds `Vlan$subnetId` in the request's `vpcId`, with the
//!   CIDR block the request gave that VLAN, marked `Elastic VMware Service` — the one
//!   value `Subnet$Type` takes for "a subnet used with Amazon Elastic VMware Service
//!   (EVS)" (that member's own doc in EC2's model);
//! * `Vlan$availabilityZone` is the zone of that subnet, which is the zone of the
//!   service access subnet: "Amazon EVS requires that all VPC subnets exist in a single
//!   Availability Zone in a Region where the service is available" (`vpcId` doc);
//! * `DeleteEnvironment` removes exactly those subnets from EC2 and leaves every other
//!   subnet of the VPC alone.
//!
//! Each row of the table below differs along what the rule generalises over — the
//! Region and so the zone, the zone's position in the Region, the VPC's address space,
//! the SIZE of the VLAN blocks across the published /24../28 range, and whether the HCX
//! VLAN is public — because none of those is what makes a VLAN subnet a real subnet.
//! The recorded case (ten /28 blocks of a `10.0.0.0/16` VPC in `us-west-2`) is one row.
//!
//! The network every row deploys into is created through Amazon EC2 ITSELF over the
//! wire (`CreateVpc`, `CreateSubnet`), so what the rows assert is that the two services
//! read and write ONE store.
