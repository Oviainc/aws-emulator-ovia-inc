//! `DeleteEntitlement`, end to end over awsJson1_0.
//!
//! The rules under test, and where each comes from:
//!
//! * A delete REMOVES the entitlement records the request names from the stored
//!   environment and reports exactly those records, stopped: "Deleting an entitlement
//!   stops usage tracking for the specified virtual machines" (`DeleteEntitlement` doc),
//!   with the response being "A list of the deleted entitlements"
//!   (`DeleteEntitlementResponse$entitlements` doc). `ListVmEntitlements` then reports the
//!   records the delete did not name and nothing else.
//! * A removed record is reported in the terminal `DELETED` status with a `stoppedAt`,
//!   "The date and time that the entitlement stopped" (`VmEntitlement$stoppedAt` doc).
//!   `EntitlementStatus` declares no state between tracking and stopped
//!   (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="EntitlementStatus")`), so the stop is immediate
//!   — whether the entitlement had settled into `CREATED` or was still `CREATING` — and
//!   no later clock change revives it.
//! * The (connector, VM) pair identifies an entitlement, so a `vmIds` list naming one VM
//!   twice names one record, and re-entitling that pair after a delete mints a fresh
//!   record rather than finding the deleted one.
//! * The operation is `@idempotent` (`smithy_query(query="operation",
//!   operation="DeleteEntitlement")`) and the end state is what the call asks for — the
//!   named virtual machines are not entitled — so a `vmId` the environment holds no such
//!   record for is a success that removes nothing, exactly as a repeat of
//!   `DisassociateEipFromVlan`'s removal is.
//! * The environment and the connector are resources the request ADDRESSES: an
//!   `environmentId` this service holds no live environment for in the request's Region,
//!   or a `connectorId` that environment holds no live connector for, is a
//!   `ResourceNotFoundException` naming the resource the request asked for ("The resource
//!   might not be specified correctly, or it may have a `state` of `DELETED`",
//!   `ResourceNotFoundException` doc), and nothing is removed for it. Every modelled
//!   client error of this awsJson1_0 service is reported with HTTP 400 —
//!   `tests/all/error_wire_status.rs` owns that rule.
//!
//! The harness (`emulator`, `call`) is the one `environment_lifecycle` already owns, and
//! the environment-with-a-vCenter-connector setup is `entitlement_connector`'s, so every
//! test drives the service the way a client does: `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: AmazonElasticVMwareService.<Operation>`.
