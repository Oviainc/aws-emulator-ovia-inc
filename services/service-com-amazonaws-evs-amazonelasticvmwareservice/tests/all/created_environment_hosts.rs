//! The ESX hosts a `CreateEnvironment` request asks Amazon EVS to ADD, over awsJson1_0.
//!
//! The rule under test, from the model's own documentation
//! (`smithy_query(query="operation",operation="CreateEnvironment")` and the member docs
//! it quotes): `hosts` is "The ESX hosts to add to the environment" and "When you specify
//! any other VCF version, Amazon EVS installs and configures VCF for you" — so a create
//! that carries hosts MATERIALISES them as hosts of the environment it mints, exactly as
//! `CreateEnvironmentHost` materialises the one host it adds:
//!
//! * `ListEnvironmentHosts` reports one `Host` per entry, carrying the `hostName`,
//!   `keyName`, `instanceType`, `placementGroupId` and `dedicatedHostId` the entry
//!   supplied, each `CREATING` until the build the clock owes it comes due;
//! * each host is addressed out of the environment's own `vmkManagement` VLAN subnet and
//!   runs on an EC2 bare metal instance of the account's own Amazon EC2 store ("An ESX
//!   host that runs on an Amazon EC2 bare metal instance", `Host` doc);
//! * the names those hosts take are taken: "DNS hostnames for hosts must be unique across
//!   Amazon EVS environments and within VCF" (`HostInfoForCreate$hostName` doc), so a
//!   later `CreateEnvironmentHost` for one of them, and a later create naming one of them,
//!   are refused; and
//! * `SELF_DEPLOYED` adds none of them: "no hosts are added and no VCF installation is
//!   performed. After the environment is created, you can add hosts with
//!   CreateEnvironmentHost".
//!
//! Both services are mounted on ONE shared engine here, and every call goes over the wire
//! a client makes it on — awsJson1_0 for Amazon EVS, ec2Query for Amazon EC2 — so the
//! placement groups and Dedicated Hosts the rows name are minted by Amazon EC2 itself and
//! the instances the hosts run on are read back from it.
