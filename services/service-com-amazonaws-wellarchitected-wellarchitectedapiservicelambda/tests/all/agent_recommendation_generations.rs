//! End-to-end HTTP tests for an agent profile's recommendation generations:
//! `StartAgentRecommendationGeneration`, which records one, the
//! `GetAgentRecommendationGeneration` that reports it, and the
//! `ListAgentRecommendationGenerations` that pages over them.
//!
//! The rules pinned here, each over a TABLE of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. `GetAgentRecommendationGeneration` REPORTS the generation the start recorded: the
//!    minted `UUID`, the `profileArn` it was started against, the `name`, `scope` and
//!    `additionalContext` as sent, and the `createdBy` / `createdAt` the service owns.
//! 2. A generation is a JOB whose status is owed by the CLOCK: it is `QUEUED` until its
//!    analysis is due to start, `IN_PROGRESS` until it is due to finish and then the
//!    terminal `COMPLETED`, with `startedAt` / `endedAt` appearing exactly when those
//!    instants pass and `lastModifiedAt` reporting the latest transition that happened.
//!    Both spans are non-zero, so a caller polling straight after the start call still
//!    observes `QUEUED`.
//! 3. `progress` agrees with the scope and the status: `totalSteps` is how many pillars
//!    the generation's scope names, `stepsCompleted` grows from 0 to that total and
//!    `completionPercentage` is that same share as a percentage — 0 while queued and 100
//!    once complete.
//! 4. Reading a generation changes nothing a later caller sees: repeated polls report the
//!    same identity, scope and instants, and the status only ever moves forwards.
//! 5. A generation is reached only THROUGH its profile: an id that belongs to another
//!    profile, or to none, is a `404 ResourceNotFoundException` naming the composite
//!    resource id and the missing resource's type, and a value the modelled `UUID` /
//!    `AgentProfileArn` pattern refuses never reaches the lookup — the boundary refuses it
//!    `400 ValidationException`.
//! 6. `StartAgentRecommendationGeneration` is modelled `@idempotent`: repeating a start
//!    request while the generation it started is still in flight answers THAT generation
//!    and records no second one, while a request differing in any member starts its own.
//! 7. A start the service cannot serve is refused `400 ValidationException` and records
//!    nothing: a `profileArn` that names no stored profile, a profile that names no
//!    aggregation scope to analyse (the derived `eligibleFor…` answer `GetAgentProfile`
//!    reports), a `scope.goalIds` entry that names no goal of that profile, and a value
//!    outside a published enum's set.
//! 8. `additionalContext` is an untyped `Document`, so its nesting is caller-chosen: a
//!    document nested to the ceiling this service holds documents to
//!    ([`state::MAX_DOCUMENT_DEPTH`]) round-trips as sent, and one past it is refused
//!    `400 ValidationException` rather than walked.
//! 9. A generation does not outlive the profile it is reached through: deleting the
//!    profile takes its generations with it, which is what keeps the per-profile ceiling
//!    a real bound on the store — an `AgentProfileArn` is never minted twice, so a
//!    generation left under a deleted profile's ARN could never be reclaimed.
//! 10. `ListAgentRecommendationGenerations` reports the generations of ONE profile, in
//!     one stable id order: another profile's generations never appear, a profile that
//!     holds none reports an empty `items`, and a well-formed `profileArn` that names no
//!     stored profile is this operation's modelled `404 ResourceNotFoundException`
//!     (unlike `ListAgentContexts`, which models no such error and so reports an empty
//!     page). The path resource is resolved BEFORE the query members are judged.
//! 11. Its optional `RecommendationType` filter selects the generations started for that
//!     type and nothing else, for EVERY published value, and a value outside the enum's
//!     published set is refused `400 ValidationException` rather than read as "no filter".
//! 12. Paging enumerates every selected generation EXACTLY ONCE: no page is longer than
//!     the `maxResults` asked for, the ids ascend across the pages, the union of the pages
//!     is the whole selected set, and only the last page omits `nextToken` — with and
//!     without the type filter. `maxResults` is held to its published
//!     `@range(min: 1, max: 1000)`, and a `nextToken` this service did not issue is
//!     refused `400 ValidationException` with reason `CANNOT_PARSE` naming the member.
//! 13. Generations are metered PER PROFILE: a profile holding the quota refuses the next
//!     start `402 ServiceQuotaExceededException` and records nothing further, while a
//!     sibling profile still takes one.
//!
//! Requests go through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, boundary constraint validation and the handler all run as they do
//! in production. The HTTP client lives in `super::workload_harness`; the profile the
//! generations hang off, and the goals a scope may name, are minted by the operations in
//! `super::agent_goals`.
