//! End-to-end HTTP tests for the VALUES a tag write may record on a resource of this
//! service, across the two tag shapes a resource's tags are reported through.
//!
//! The rules pinned here, each over a TABLE of values rather than one recorded request:
//!
//! 1. `TagResource` records a pair only when the tag shape the RESOURCE's own reads
//!    project its tags through can carry it. An agent profile reports its tags as modelled
//!    `Tag` structures, whose `value` is `@required` `@length(min: 1, max: 256)` over the
//!    character class `^[\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]+$`
//!    (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="Tag")`), so a value only a `TagMap`'s
//!    `TagValue` (`@length(max: 256)`, no minimum, no pattern) admits is refused
//!    `400 ValidationException` naming the map entry to fix, and nothing is recorded —
//!    while every value both shapes admit round-trips through `GetAgentProfile`,
//!    `ListAgentProfiles` and `ListTagsForResource`.
//! 2. The rule belongs to the RESOURCE, not to the operation: a resource whose tags are
//!    reported ONLY as a `TagMap` still records every value that map admits, including the
//!    ones an agent profile refuses.
//! 3. The two doors onto one agent profile agree: a value `TagResource` refuses for a
//!    profile is a value `CreateAgentProfile` refuses in its `tags` list, and a value one
//!    records is a value the other records.
//!
//! Requests go through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, boundary constraint validation and the handler all run as they do in
//! production. The HTTP client is `super::workload_harness`'s; the profiles, the tag write
//! and the tag reads are the wire helpers of the suites that own those operations, because
//! a resource is minted, tagged and read by exactly one operation each.
