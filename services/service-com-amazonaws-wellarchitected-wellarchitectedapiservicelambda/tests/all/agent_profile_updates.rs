//! End-to-end HTTP tests for `UpdateAgentProfile` — the update half of the agent-profile
//! lifecycle whose create and read are pinned by `super::get_agent_profile` and whose
//! delete is pinned by `super::agent_profile_lifecycle`.
//!
//! The rules pinned here, each over a TABLE of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. An update MERGES: every member the request carries replaces the stored one and
//!    every member it omits is left exactly as it was — never nulled — whatever the
//!    profile carried and whichever members the request names. The members no update
//!    request models (`arn`, `name`, `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `tags`) cannot change.
//! 2. The modification is RECORDED: `lastModifiedBy` is the account the request is
//!    attributed to and `lastModifiedAt` the instant it happened — both absent on a
//!    profile nothing has updated yet.
//! 3. The reporting members are DERIVED from the profile as it now stands, not from the
//!    create: an update that leaves the profile with no scope to analyse reports
//!    `eligibleFor…` false and a `fieldErrors` entry for the member at fault, and one that
//!    gives it a scope again reports them eligible with no `fieldErrors`.
//! 4. The update is persisted: `GetAgentProfile` of the ARN afterwards reports exactly
//!    what the update answered, and every OTHER stored profile is untouched.
//! 5. The stored `deletionProtection` is what the delete reads, so an update that clears
//!    it lets the profile be deleted and one that sets it refuses the delete.
//! 6. An `AgentProfileArn` is RESOLVED against the store: one naming no stored profile is
//!    a `404 ResourceNotFoundException` carrying the ARN as sent, and it stores nothing.
//! 7. `clientToken` makes the update idempotent: the same token with the same parameters
//!    applies nothing a second time — it answers the profile as it stands and records no
//!    second modification — while the same token with other parameters is the update it
//!    is. A delete drops the tokens that resolved to the profile.
//!
//! Requests go through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, boundary constraint validation and the handler all run as they do in
//! production. The HTTP client lives in `super::workload_harness`.
