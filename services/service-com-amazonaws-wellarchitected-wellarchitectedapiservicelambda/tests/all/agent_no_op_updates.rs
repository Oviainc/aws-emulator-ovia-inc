//! End-to-end HTTP tests for the AGENT-PLANE update that supplies no writable member.
//!
//! The rule these pin, over tables of inputs rather than one request: an update whose every
//! WRITABLE member is optional treats a request that supplies NONE of them as asking for no
//! change — it reports the resource exactly as it stands and records no modification, so
//! `lastModifiedBy` and `lastModifiedAt` keep whatever they held (absent on a resource
//! nothing has modified yet) — while a member the request DOES supply is a write even at the
//! emptiest value the model allows it, and that write IS the modification the resource
//! reports.
//!
//! The suites cover the three agent-plane updates the rule reaches, each of which models
//! every writable member as optional with only the path identifiers `@required`
//! (`smithy_query(query="operation", operation="UpdateAgentContext")` and the same for
//! `UpdateAgentGoal` and `UpdateAgentProfile`): `UpdateAgentContext` (`title`, `content`),
//! `UpdateAgentGoal` (`pillars`, `title`, `description`) and `UpdateAgentProfile`
//! (`displayName`, `description`, `businessOverview`, `pillars`, `executionRoleArn`,
//! `aggregationConfiguration`, `deletionProtection`). The same rule over the workload plane
//! is pinned by `super::no_op_updates`.
//!
//! Requests go through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, boundary constraint validation and the handler all run as they do in
//! production. The request builders are the ones the suites about each update own, and the
//! resources these rows drive are created through the shared create helpers.
