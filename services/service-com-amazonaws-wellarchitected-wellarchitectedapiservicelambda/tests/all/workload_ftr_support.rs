//! End-to-end HTTP tests for `Workload$FTRSupported`, the flag saying whether a workload
//! is supported for a Foundational Technical Review.
//!
//! The rule pinned here, over a TABLE of workloads and of the reads that project them
//! rather than one recorded request: every projection of a stored workload REPORTS the
//! flag — `false` for a workload that is not FTR-supported, rather than leaving the member
//! out — so a caller reading it to decide whether to offer the workflow can tell "not
//! supported" from "unknown". No operation this service exposes enrols a workload in that
//! review, so no workload this emulator holds is FTR-supported.
//!
//! The member is absent from the on-disk model snapshot and was added to it from the
//! recorded AWS responses; see `Workload::ftr_supported` in `src/ops/types/shared_types.rs`.
//!
//! Requests go through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, boundary constraint validation and the handler all run as they do in
//! production. The HTTP client and the request builders are the shared
//! `super::workload_harness`.
