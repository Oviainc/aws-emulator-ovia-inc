//! End-to-end HTTP tests for `CreateAgentProfile` — the create that mints an agent
//! profile (`POST /api/v1/agent-profiles`, `smithy_query(query="operation",
//! operation="CreateAgentProfile")`).
//!
//! The round trip of a created profile and its derived members is pinned by
//! `super::agent_goals`, and the resolution of several stored profiles by
//! `super::get_agent_profile`. What this suite adds is the part of the create's own
//! modelled surface those do not reach, each rule over a TABLE of inputs rather than one
//! request:
//!
//! 1. IDEMPOTENCY. `clientToken` is modelled `@idempotencyToken`: the same token with the
//!    same parameters answers the profile the first request created and records no second
//!    one, the same token with ANY parameter changed is a `409 ConflictException` naming
//!    the profile that token already created and recording nothing, and a fresh token —
//!    or no token at all — mints a new profile even when every other member is identical.
//!    The rows differ along WHICH member changed, because what makes a second request a
//!    different request is any parameter of it, not one particular member.
//! 2. METERING. Agent profiles are metered: a create AT the ceiling is accepted and the
//!    one past it is refused `402 ServiceQuotaExceededException` naming the kind of
//!    resource the quota meters, the ceiling it reached and the `@required` `QuotaCode` /
//!    `ServiceCode`, and records nothing — while the profiles inside the ceiling still
//!    resolve.
//! 3. THE TAG CEILING. A create stores at most as many tags as one resource of this
//!    service may hold: rows up to that ceiling are recorded (a repeated key being one
//!    tag and not two), rows past it are refused `400 ValidationException` naming the
//!    `tags` member and record nothing, and a profile the create stored is still a full
//!    member of the tagging plane — `TagResource` takes it from one below the ceiling to
//!    the ceiling, and refuses a new key only once it is AT the ceiling. The rows differ
//!    along the COUNT of tags the create carries, which is what the rule generalises
//!    over.
//!
//! Requests go through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, boundary constraint validation and the handler all run as they do in
//! production. The HTTP client lives in `super::workload_harness`; the agent-profile
//! request builders and the profile projection check live in `super::agent_goals`.
