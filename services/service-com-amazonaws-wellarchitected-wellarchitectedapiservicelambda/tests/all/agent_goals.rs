//! End-to-end HTTP tests for an agent profile's optimization goals: `CreateAgentGoal`,
//! the `GetAgentGoal` that reads one back, `DeleteAgentGoal` that removes one, and the
//! `CreateAgentProfile` / `GetAgentProfile` pair the goals hang off.
//!
//! The rules pinned here, each over a TABLE of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. A goal is STORED under the profile it was created against: `CreateAgentGoal`
//!    answers a `GoalSummary` carrying the request's members, a freshly minted `UUID`
//!    and the `createdBy` / `createdAt` the service owns, and `GetAgentGoal` of that id
//!    reports the identical summary.
//! 2. `DeleteAgentGoal` removes EXACTLY the goal its `(profileArn, id)` pair resolves
//!    to: that goal then answers 404 to `GetAgentGoal` and to a repeat
//!    `DeleteAgentGoal`, while every other goal of the profile still resolves unchanged.
//! 3. A goal is reached only THROUGH its profile: the same goal id under another
//!    profile's ARN resolves to nothing, and a well-formed `profileArn` or goal `id`
//!    that names no stored resource is answered `404 ResourceNotFoundException`
//!    carrying the identifier as sent and the missing resource's type. A value the
//!    modelled `AgentProfileArn` / `UUID` pattern refuses never reaches the lookup: the
//!    boundary refuses it as a `400 ValidationException` naming the member.
//! 4. A `clientToken` makes `CreateAgentGoal` idempotent: the same token with the same
//!    parameters answers the goal the original request created, the same token with
//!    different parameters is a `409 ConflictException`, and a fresh token records a
//!    second goal.
//! 5. `CreateAgentProfile` persists what the request carried and `GetAgentProfile`
//!    reports it, plus the members the service DERIVES from the stored profile: a
//!    profile that names no aggregation scope is eligible for neither kind of
//!    generation and says so in `fieldErrors`; one that names a scope is eligible for
//!    both and reports no field errors.
//!
//! Requests go through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, boundary constraint validation and the handler all run as they do
//! in production. The HTTP client lives in `super::workload_harness`.
