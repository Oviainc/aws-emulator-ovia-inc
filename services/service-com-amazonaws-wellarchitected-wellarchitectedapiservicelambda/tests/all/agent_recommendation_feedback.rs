//! End-to-end HTTP tests for `PutAgentRecommendationFeedback`: the write that "submits
//! user feedback on a recommendation to help improve future optimization suggestions and
//! track implementation outcomes".
//!
//! The rules pinned here, each over a TABLE of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. A submission is recorded as the feedback sub-resource of the recommendation its
//!    `recommendationArn` names — the type it judges the finding with, the category it
//!    classifies the judgement under and the comments it adds, attributed to the caller and
//!    to the instant it was accepted — and answers an empty 200.
//! 2. The whole sub-resource is PUT: an optional member a submission omits is absent in
//!    what is held rather than inherited from an earlier submission, and a later
//!    submission replaces the one that stood.
//! 3. `@idempotent`: resubmitting the feedback a recommendation already holds leaves it
//!    exactly as it stood, the instant it was accepted at included.
//! 4. Feedback judges the finding rather than modifying it: every operation that reports
//!    the recommendation answers after a submission exactly as it did before.
//! 5. A request the service cannot serve changes nothing: a `recommendationArn` that names
//!    no recommendation is `404 ResourceNotFoundException` carrying the ARN as sent and the
//!    missing resource's type, and a member outside its modelled enum, length bounds or
//!    pattern — or a missing `@required` member — is `400 ValidationException`.
//!
//! Requests go through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, so routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, boundary constraint validation and the handler all run as they do in
//! production. Nothing in this API reports feedback back
//! (`PutAgentRecommendationFeedbackResponse` is an empty structure), so what was recorded
//! is read off the state the handlers share, through the same accessor they use; everything
//! about behaviour crosses the HTTP boundary.
//!
//! The HTTP client lives in `super::workload_harness`; the profile and the generation whose
//! completion produces the recommendations come from the suites beside this one.
