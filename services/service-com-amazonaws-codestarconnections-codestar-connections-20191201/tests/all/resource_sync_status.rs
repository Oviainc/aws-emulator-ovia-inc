//! End-to-end tests for `GetResourceSyncStatus`.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire: a request is dispatched through the
//! [`MultiServiceRouter`](smithy_server_runtime::MultiServiceRouter) exactly as the
//! emulator's front door does it (`POST /` + `X-Amz-Target:
//! CodeStar_connections_20191201.GetResourceSyncStatus`, awsJson1_0 body), so what is
//! asserted here is the service's HTTP behaviour and not a handler called directly.
//!
//! The rule these suites assert: the operation reports the sync state this service has
//! recorded against the `(SyncType, ResourceName)` pair the request names, and nothing
//! else — a pair it holds no row for SUCCEEDS with none of `DesiredState`, `LatestSync`
//! and `LatestSuccessfulSync` present rather than being refused, so a client polling
//! before the resource has ever synced can tell "never synced" from "bad request". A sync
//! attempt is recorded by the service's Git-sync component, which this emulator does not
//! run, so the attempts reported here are put in the store directly, through the SAME
//! records the handler reads (`codestar::state::StoredResourceSyncState`) — which is what
//! makes these assertions evidence that the response is computed from persisted state
//! rather than from a constant.
//!
//! The tables span what the rule generalises over: whether a pair holds a row at all,
//! which of the three members that row records, every modeled `ResourceSyncStatus`, how
//! many events an attempt carries (none, one, several), whether an event carries an
//! external id, every modeled `SyncConfigurationType`, and the published `ResourceName`
//! bounds and forms. The recorded request (an unsynced resource, nothing recorded) is ONE
//! row.
