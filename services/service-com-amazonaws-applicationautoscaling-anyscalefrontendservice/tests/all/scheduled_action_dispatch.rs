//! WHEN a scheduled action fires, and what a client that only watches the SCALED RESOURCE
//! sees of it.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! * a scheduled action's occurrence takes effect at its own instant, moving the capacity of
//!   the resource the target scales in the service that owns that resource — no further
//!   Application Auto Scaling call is needed for it, because nothing the clock owes waits for
//!   a caller;
//! * the instant is the one the action's own `Timezone` makes it, not the UTC reading of the
//!   wall clock the expression carries;
//! * occurrences take effect in the order of the INSTANTS they are due at, so the capacity a
//!   target is left at is the one the latest-scheduled occurrence set, whatever order the
//!   actions were created in or named with;
//! * a capacity movement is reported as a NON-TERMINAL scaling activity until it is fulfilled,
//!   so a client POLLING `DescribeScalingActivities` observes that status before `Successful`;
//! * the action stays listed by `DescribeScheduledActions` after it has fired.
//!
//! Every suite spans more than the one case the issue cited: the resource owner (a DynamoDB
//! table's provisioned capacity and an ECS service's desired count), the schedule form (`at`
//! and `cron`), the time zone the schedule is read in (ahead of UTC and behind it), and the
//! creation order of a queue of actions.
