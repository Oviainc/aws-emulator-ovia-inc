//! End-to-end cover for the RELATIONAL half of the IoT SiteWise query language, as
//! `ExecuteQuery` answers it over HTTP through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! emulator boots with.
//!
//! The rule these suites pin: a query statement is a relational expression over the
//! views this service exposes, so every statement of the language — a join across
//! views, a grouped or ungrouped aggregate, a computed selection, `DISTINCT`, a set
//! operation, a subquery or a `WITH` definition, ordered and paged — is COMPUTED
//! from the rows the store holds, and only a statement outside that language is
//! refused (with one of the operation's modelled errors).
//!
//! Every suite is a TABLE whose rows differ along what the rule generalises over:
//! which relations are paired and how, which aggregate reduces them, what the
//! grouping key is, which expression form the projection computes, and which set
//! operation combines two results. Nothing is asserted against a remembered value:
//! each row's expectation follows from the resources the fixture wrote, and the last
//! suite writes one more sample and shows the answers move with it.
//!
//! The HTTP harness (`call`, `router`, `create_model`, …) and the result readers
//! (`query`, `rows`, `column_names`) are the ones the asset and `ExecuteQuery` suites
//! already define; this suite reuses them rather than growing a second.
