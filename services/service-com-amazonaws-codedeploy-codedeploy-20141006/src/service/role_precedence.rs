//! What a deployment group's create and update answer BEFORE a refusal of the
//! request body: the SERVICE ROLE the group is to run as.
//!
//! CodeDeploy judges the role first. A `serviceRoleArn` that is no IAM role ARN,
//! and one naming a role of this account that does not let CodeDeploy assume it,
//! are both refused with the modelled `InvalidRoleException` — before the request's
//! other member VALUES are judged, as the recorded service does for a request that
//! carries an out-of-enum tag-filter type beside such a role.
//!
//! The handlers in `crate::ops` already keep that order among the checks they make
//! ([`crate::state::check_service_role_arn`] needs no state, and the trust verdict
//! is read before the store is touched). The framework's own walk does not: it
//! validates the whole input against the operation's generated schema and refuses a
//! modelled constraint BEFORE `handle` runs
//! (`vendor/smithy-server-runtime/src/operation.rs`), so for a request that breaks
//! one of those constraints the member refusal reached the caller first and the role
//! was never judged. A client catching the modelled `InvalidRoleException` — the
//! retry-on-a-freshly-created-role loop the error exists for — saw a parameter
//! complaint instead.
//!
//! This layer restores the order for exactly those requests. It runs in the one seam
//! a service has BEFORE dispatch
//! (`smithy_server_runtime::Service::override_operation`), and it claims a request
//! only when ALL of:
//!
//! * the operation it was sent to SETS a deployment group's service role —
//!   `CreateDeploymentGroup` or `UpdateDeploymentGroup`, the two operations that
//!   take a `serviceRoleArn` and model `InvalidRoleException` for it;
//! * the framework's validating walk would refuse the body. The walk is run HERE,
//!   through the same `aws_smithy_schema_server::constraints::validate` and the same
//!   generated input schema the dispatch sequence runs, so this layer cannot
//!   disagree with the walk that would otherwise follow it. A request whose body the
//!   walk accepts is NOT claimed: its handler already judges the role in the right
//!   order, and nothing here may change what it reports;
//! * the role actually earns a refusal. Otherwise the request falls through to the
//!   modelled operation, which refuses the body exactly as before.
//!
//! The answers are the service's own modelled shapes, rendered through the same
//! protocol call the framework's error tail makes, and built by the same functions
//! the handlers build them with — so a refusal worded here and one worded there are
//! indistinguishable on the wire.
//!
//! WHICH resource the trust verdict is given about: a role the account's IAM holds
//! and whose trust policy withholds the assume is refused only once everything the
//! request names AHEAD of the role has resolved — the deployment configuration it
//! names, the application a group is created under, the group an update names —
//! because the recorded service answers an application it does not hold first, and
//! the handler answers a configuration it does not hold before that. A request this
//! layer cannot resolve those for falls through to the handler, which answers the
//! missing one.
