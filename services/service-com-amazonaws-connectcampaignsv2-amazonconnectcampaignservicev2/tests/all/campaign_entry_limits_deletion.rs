//! `DeleteCampaignEntryLimits`, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives real HTTP through the router the production entrypoint serves,
//! so each assertion exercises the restJson1 wire protocol, the modelled constraints
//! and the handler together. The rules under test:
//!
//! * the call removes the `entryLimitsConfig` the campaign named by `{id}` holds, and
//!   nothing else: every other member of the campaign stays as it was, which is what
//!   every later read (`DescribeCampaign`, `ListCampaigns`) projects, and a campaign
//!   holding no config carries the member absent rather than empty;
//! * the operation is idempotent (`@idempotent` in the model, "This API is idempotent"
//!   in its documentation): a campaign carrying no entry limits config is a 200 that
//!   removes nothing;
//! * the deletion and `UpdateCampaignEntryLimits` round-trip: a config can be stored,
//!   removed and stored again;
//! * an id the store does not hold is HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and removes
//!   nothing;
//! * a campaign whose state is terminal takes no configuration change, which is this
//!   operation's `InvalidCampaignStateException` — judged on the state every reader
//!   reports, so a campaign whose run window has closed is refused too.
