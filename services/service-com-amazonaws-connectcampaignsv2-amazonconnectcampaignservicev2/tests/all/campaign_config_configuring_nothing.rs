//! A campaign configuration that configures NOTHING, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every member of `ChannelSubtypeConfig` (`telephony`, `sms`, `email`, `whatsApp`) and
//! of `CommunicationLimitsConfig` (`allChannelSubtypes`, `instanceLimitsHandling`) is
//! optional, and both members that carry them on `Campaign` are optional too, so a
//! request can carry a config holding no member at all. The rule under test: such a
//! config configures nothing, so the record carries NO member rather than an empty
//! structure — whichever call wrote it (`CreateCampaign`, the member's own update, or the
//! deletion that takes the last block out), which is what makes
//! `DescribeCampaign` -> update a round trip and lets a client branch on the member's
//! presence.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: which of the two members is written,
//! which path writes it (create or update), how many members the config holds (none,
//! one, two, every one of them), which member that is — the channels from the model's
//! `ChannelSubtype` catalog (`CHANNEL_SUBTYPE_VALUES`) and the handling values from
//! `INSTANCE_LIMITS_HANDLING_VALUES` — and what the record held before the write.
