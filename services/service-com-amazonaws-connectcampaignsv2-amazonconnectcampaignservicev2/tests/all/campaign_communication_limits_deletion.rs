//! `DeleteCampaignCommunicationLimits`, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives real HTTP through the router the production entrypoint serves,
//! so each assertion exercises the restJson1 wire protocol, the modelled constraints
//! and the handler together. The rules under test:
//!
//! * the call removes the communication-limits block that the campaign named by `{id}`
//!   holds in its stored `communicationLimitsOverride` for the ONE config `config`
//!   names, and nothing else: every other member of that override — and every other
//!   member of the campaign — stays as it was, which is what every later read
//!   (`DescribeCampaign`) projects. An override left with no member at all is absent
//!   rather than empty;
//! * the operation is idempotent (`@idempotent` in the model, "This API is idempotent"
//!   in its documentation): a config whose block is not set, and a campaign carrying no
//!   override at all, are a 200 that removes nothing;
//! * an id the store does not hold is HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and removes
//!   nothing;
//! * a `config` outside the model's `CommunicationLimitsConfigType` catalog is HTTP 400
//!   `ValidationException` and removes nothing;
//! * a campaign in a non-terminal lifecycle state takes the deletion.
