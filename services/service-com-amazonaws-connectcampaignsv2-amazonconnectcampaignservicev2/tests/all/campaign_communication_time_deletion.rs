//! `DeleteCampaignCommunicationTime`, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives real HTTP through the router the production entrypoint serves,
//! so each assertion exercises the restJson1 wire protocol, the modelled constraints
//! and the handler together. The rules under test:
//!
//! * the call removes the communication time window the campaign `{id}` names holds
//!   for the ONE channel `config` names, and nothing else: the config's required
//!   `localTimeZoneConfig` and every other channel's window stay as they were, and so
//!   does every other member of the campaign — which is what every later read
//!   (`DescribeCampaign`) projects;
//! * the operation is idempotent (`@idempotent` in the model, "This API is
//!   idempotent" in its documentation): a channel that holds no window, and a
//!   campaign carrying no communication time config at all, are a 200 that removes
//!   nothing;
//! * an id the store does not hold is HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and
//!   removes nothing;
//! * a `config` outside the model's `CommunicationTimeConfigType` catalog is HTTP 400
//!   `ValidationException` and removes nothing;
//! * a campaign in a non-terminal lifecycle state takes the deletion.
