//! `UpdateCampaignFlowAssociation`, end to end over the wire.

//! Every case drives real HTTP through the router the production entrypoint serves,
//! so each assertion exercises the restJson1 wire protocol, the modelled constraints
//! and the handler together. The rules under test:
//!
//! * the call ASSOCIATES the `connectCampaignFlowArn` it was given with the campaign
//!   `{id}` names, replacing whatever flow that campaign was associated with, and the
//!   association is what every later read of the campaign (`DescribeCampaign`,
//!   `ListCampaigns`) projects — nothing else about the campaign changes;
//! * the operation is idempotent (`@idempotent` in the model, "This API is
//!   idempotent" in its documentation): repeating it with the same ARN leaves the
//!   same association;
//! * an id the store does not hold is HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and
//!   associates nothing;
//! * an ARN outside `Arn`'s modelled constraints (len 20..500, the `^arn:…$` pattern)
//!   is HTTP 400 `ValidationException` and leaves the stored association alone;
//! * a campaign in a terminal lifecycle state takes no configuration change, which is
//!   this operation's `InvalidCampaignStateException`.
