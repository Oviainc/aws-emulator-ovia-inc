//! `UpdateCampaignCommunicationTime`, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives real HTTP through the router the production entrypoint serves,
//! so each assertion exercises the restJson1 wire protocol, the modelled constraints
//! and the handler together. The rules under test:
//!
//! * the call sets the campaign `{id}` names to the `communicationTimeConfig` the
//!   request carries and REPLACES whatever it held — the config is one modelled
//!   structure, so a channel the new config leaves out is a channel the campaign no
//!   longer opens, and its `localTimeZoneConfig` is the new one — which is what every
//!   later read (`DescribeCampaign`) projects, while every other member of the
//!   campaign stays as it was;
//! * the operation is idempotent (`@idempotent` in the model, "This API is
//!   idempotent" in its documentation): the same config sent twice leaves the
//!   campaign exactly as the first call left it;
//! * an id the store does not hold is HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and stores
//!   nothing;
//! * a `dailyHours` key outside the model's `DayOfWeek` catalog is HTTP 400
//!   `ValidationException` and stores nothing, on the update and on `CreateCampaign`
//!   alike;
//! * a campaign in a non-terminal lifecycle state takes the update.
