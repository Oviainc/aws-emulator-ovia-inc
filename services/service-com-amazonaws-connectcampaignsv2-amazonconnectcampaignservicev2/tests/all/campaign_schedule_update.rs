//! `UpdateCampaignSchedule`, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives real HTTP through the router the production entrypoint serves,
//! so each assertion exercises the restJson1 wire protocol, the modelled constraints
//! and the handler together. The rules under test:
//!
//! * the call sets the campaign `{id}` names to the `schedule` the request carries and
//!   REPLACES whatever it held — the schedule is one modelled structure, so a schedule
//!   that leaves `refreshFrequency` out is a campaign that carries none — which is what
//!   every later read (`DescribeCampaign`, `ListCampaigns`) projects, while every other
//!   member of the campaign stays as it was;
//! * the operation is idempotent (`@idempotent` in the model, "This API is idempotent"
//!   in its documentation): the same schedule sent twice leaves the campaign exactly as
//!   the first call left it;
//! * the window the stored schedule now carries is the one the campaign's state is
//!   derived from, so a running campaign rescheduled past its `endTime` is `Completed`
//!   and one rescheduled into an open window keeps running;
//! * an id the store does not hold is HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and stores
//!   nothing;
//! * a campaign in a terminal lifecycle state is past being reconfigured: HTTP 409
//!   `InvalidCampaignStateException` naming that state, storing nothing, while every
//!   non-terminal state takes the update;
//! * a `refreshFrequency` outside the modelled `Iso8601Duration` pattern is HTTP 400
//!   `ValidationException` and stores nothing.
