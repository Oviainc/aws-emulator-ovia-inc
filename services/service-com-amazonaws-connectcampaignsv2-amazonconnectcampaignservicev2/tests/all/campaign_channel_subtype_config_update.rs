//! `UpdateCampaignChannelSubtypeConfig`, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives real HTTP through the router the production entrypoint serves,
//! so each assertion exercises the restJson1 wire protocol, the modelled constraints
//! and the handler together. The rules under test:
//!
//! * the call sets the campaign `{id}` names to the `channelSubtypeConfig` the request
//!   carries and REPLACES whatever it held — the config is one modelled structure, so a
//!   channel the new config leaves out is a channel the campaign is no longer
//!   configured for — which is what every later read projects (`DescribeCampaign`, and
//!   `ListCampaigns`' derived `channelSubtypes`), while every other member of the
//!   campaign stays as it was;
//! * the operation is idempotent (`@idempotent` in the model, "This API is idempotent"
//!   in its documentation): the same config sent twice leaves the campaign exactly as
//!   the first call left it;
//! * an id the store does not hold is HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and stores
//!   nothing — including an id that names a campaign of ANOTHER region, which this
//!   region's endpoint does not reach;
//! * the update turns on the campaign existing, not on where its lifecycle is: this
//!   operation models no `InvalidCampaignStateException`, so every state the campaign
//!   lifecycle reaches takes it.
