//! `UpdateCampaignSource`, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives real HTTP through the router the production entrypoint serves,
//! so each assertion exercises the restJson1 wire protocol, the modelled constraints
//! and the handler together. The rules under test:
//!
//! * the call SETS the campaign `{id}` names to be sourced from the `source` the
//!   request carries, replacing whatever that campaign was sourced from, and the stored
//!   source is what every later read of the campaign (`DescribeCampaign`) projects —
//!   nothing else about the campaign changes;
//! * `Source` is a union, so exactly ONE member is in force: an update naming the
//!   other member leaves no trace of the one it replaced;
//! * the operation is idempotent (`@idempotent` in the model, "This API is
//!   idempotent" in its documentation): repeating it with the same source leaves the
//!   same source;
//! * an id the store does not hold is HTTP 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and stores
//!   nothing;
//! * the required member omitted is HTTP 400 `ValidationException` and leaves the
//!   stored source alone;
//! * a campaign in a terminal lifecycle state takes no configuration change, which is
//!   this operation's HTTP 409 `InvalidCampaignStateException`.
