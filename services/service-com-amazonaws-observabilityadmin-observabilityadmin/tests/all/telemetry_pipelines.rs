//! End-to-end HTTP tests for the telemetry-pipeline slice of this service.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — the production `MultiServiceRouter`,
//! restJson1 serialization, the modelled-constraint walk and the handlers — through
//! the ONE harness this test crate has (`telemetry_rules`), so what is asserted is
//! what a signed AWS SDK request observes.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! 1. `CreateTelemetryPipeline` stores ONE pipeline record, keyed by the region the
//!    request was signed for and the name, and answers its ARN; every member
//!    `GetTelemetryPipeline` reports — name, ARN, configuration body, tags and
//!    timestamps — comes from that record, whatever the configuration looks like;
//! 2. a pipeline is `CREATING` until the transition the create started comes due and
//!    `ACTIVE` from then on, so a read straight after the create still sees
//!    `CREATING` and no read ever has to write;
//! 3. the configuration body is persisted and reported back VERBATIM whatever it
//!    contains, for every body the modelled `Body` length (1..24000) admits, and a
//!    body outside that length is a 400 `ValidationException` that stores nothing:
//!    this service's model carries no schema for the sources, processors and sinks a
//!    pipeline definition names, and `ValidateTelemetryPipelineConfiguration` — the
//!    operation documented to report per-field configuration errors — is a separate
//!    scaffold stub with its own issue, so the create invents no verdict about the
//!    document's contents;
//! 4. a pipeline name identifies a pipeline within the region the request was signed
//!    for, so a second create of the same name there is a 409 and the same name in
//!    another region is a different pipeline;
//! 5. an identifier resolves as a bare name or as the full ARN, and anything that
//!    names no stored pipeline is a modelled 404.
