//! What a `ListPackageVersions` SUMMARY says about when a version was published.
//!
//! Every case drives real `restJson1` requests through the `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! production emulator serves with, so what is asserted here is the wire body a
//! CodeArtifact client parses, not a projection's return value.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one example:
//!
//! 1. Every entry of a version listing carries the version's PUBLISH INSTANT
//!    (`publishedTime`), as the epoch-seconds JSON number `restJson1` writes a timestamp
//!    as, and it is the SAME instant the same version's `DescribePackageVersion` reports:
//!    the listing projects the stored record the description reports, so the two readings
//!    of one version cannot disagree. Rows differ along the asset size, the version string's
//!    shape, the namespace, the package and the number of versions the package holds.
//! 2. The instant belongs to the PUBLISH, not to the reading or to the version's later
//!    history: listing twice reports the same number, and a version whose STATUS was moved
//!    (`UpdatePackageVersionsStatus`, `DisposePackageVersions`) or which is still
//!    `Unfinished` keeps the instant its publish recorded. Rows cover every status this
//!    service's own operations can leave a stored version in.
//! 3. The member agrees with the ORDERING the operation sorts by: under
//!    `sortBy=PUBLISHED_TIME` the most recently published version comes first, so the
//!    numbers the page reports are non-increasing — the key the listing orders on and the
//!    member it reports read one stored instant.
