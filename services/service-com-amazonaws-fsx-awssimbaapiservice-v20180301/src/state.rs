//! This holds the file-system lifecycle slice: the records `CreateFileSystem` writes and
//! that `DescribeFileSystems`, `UpdateFileSystem`, `DeleteFileSystem`, `TagResource`,
//! `UntagResource` and `ListTagsForResource` read and mutate, plus the backup slice in
//! [`backups`]: the records `CreateBackup` writes and `DescribeBackups` reads. Every
