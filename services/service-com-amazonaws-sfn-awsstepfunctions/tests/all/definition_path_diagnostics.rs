//! `X-Amz-Target: AWSStepFunctions.<Operation>`) through the production
//! `MultiServiceRouter`.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! 1. a payload-template member (`Parameters`, `ItemSelector`, `ResultSelector`) whose
//!    `"<name>.$"` value is a path that selects nothing fails the state with
//!    `States.Runtime`, and the cause names the PATH, the FIELD it was specified for
//!    and the document it was looked for in — never only the path;
//! 2. `TestState` with no `stateName` "accepts the definition of a single state", so a
//!    `definition` that is not one is refused as `InvalidDefinition` naming the
//!    required member the SUPPLIED object does not carry, and nothing in the refusal
//!    names a state, a state machine or a JSON pointer the request did not send —
//!    while a `definition` sent WITH a `stateName` is a state machine definition and is
//!    refused in the words every state machine definition of this service is refused
//!    in.
//!
//! The harness (`Emulator`, `create_machine`, `start_execution`, `describe_execution`,
//! `failure`) is the one `state_machine_lifecycle` and `error_messages` build;
//! `tests/all.rs` is this binary's crate root, so each is reached through
//! `crate::<suite>`.
