//! End-to-end tests for ACTIVITY TASKS: what a `Task` state whose `Resource` is an
//! activity ARN schedules, and what `GetActivityTask` hands a polling worker, driven
//! over this service's own wire protocol (`awsJson1_0`, `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: AWSStepFunctions.<Operation>`) through the production
//! `MultiServiceRouter`.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! 1. a `Task` state whose `Resource` is an activity ARN SCHEDULES one task under
//!    that activity, carrying the state's effective input (`InputPath`, then the
//!    `Parameters` payload template), and the execution waits at that state: it stays
//!    `RUNNING` with no outcome until the task is answered or the clock closes it;
//! 2. `GetActivityTask` hands the longest-waiting unclaimed task of the activity it
//!    names to the poll, ONCE — the `taskToken` that identifies it and that stored
//!    input — and answers an empty token when the activity has no task to hand out,
//!    after holding the poll open;
//! 3. a poll is judged in two steps, as every other activity read is: an
//!    `activityArn` that is not an activity ARN of this service in this endpoint's
//!    region is `InvalidArn` (400) before any lookup, and an ARN the store holds no
//!    activity under is `ActivityDoesNotExist` (400);
//! 4. a task the scheduling state BOUNDED is closed by the clock when that bound runs
//!    out — both `TimeoutSeconds` and `HeartbeatSeconds` running from the instant a
//!    worker took it — and the execution waiting at it then reports the language's own
//!    `States.Timeout`;
//! 5. a `Task` state that names any other integration schedules nothing: it is the
//!    call to another service this emulator does not make, so the execution ends
//!    `FAILED` with `States.Runtime` and no worker is handed anything.
//!
//! The harness (`Emulator`, `string`, `create_machine`, `start_execution`,
//! `describe_execution`) is the one `state_machine_lifecycle` builds; `tests/all.rs`
//! is this binary's crate root, so it is reached through
//! `crate::state_machine_lifecycle`.
