//! End-to-end tests for the PROJECTION the grant plane puts on the wire, driven over
//! the wire through the shared [`super::harness`].
//!
//! The sibling [`super::grants`] suite is about what the grant WRITERS persist and
//! [`super::list_grants_reads`] about which grants a reader selects. This suite is
//! about how the grants a reader selected are RENDERED, and the rules it asserts hold
//! for every grant read, not for one request shape:
//!
//! 1. A grant listing reports `GrantCount`: how many grants the `Grants` list of that
//!    response carries, including `0` beside an empty list.
//! 2. Every `GrantListEntry` carries `Name` — the name the grant was created with, or
//!    the empty string for a grant created without one.
//! 3. Every entry reports its permitted `Operations` in the order the model declares
//!    the `GrantOperation` enum's values, whatever order the creating request listed
//!    them in.
//! 4. A listing reports its grants ordered by `GrantId` ascending, which is also the
//!    order its pages concatenate in.
//! 5. `CreateGrant` reports `KeyOrigin`: the `OriginType` of the key the grant was
//!    created on, the same value `DescribeKey` reports as `KeyMetadata.Origin`.
//!
//! Both readers answer one modelled shape, so every row runs against `ListGrants` and
//! `ListRetirableGrants` alike.
//!
//! A last test here is about the MODEL rather than the wire: the snapshot in
//! `smithy-model/` is kept exactly as shipped and declares NEITHER `GrantCount` on
//! `ListGrantsResponse` nor `KeyOrigin` on `CreateGrantResponse`, which is why this
//! crate declares those members itself; it pins that, so a refreshed snapshot that
//! adds one of them is noticed instead of being shadowed.
