//! End-to-end tests for the package/domain **association** surface —
//! `AssociatePackage` and the two reads of it, `ListPackagesForDomain` and
//! `ListDomainsForPackage` — driven as real restJson1 requests through the
//! router.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a SET of inputs rather than one
//! recorded call:
//!
//! 1. A domain takes a package only once it is on the latest service software,
//!    which a domain still provisioning a change is not: that associate is
//!    refused with the modelled 400 `ValidationException` and writes nothing, so
//!    both lists still report an empty `DomainPackageDetailsList`.
//! 2. An accepted associate PERSISTS the association and answers with the stored
//!    record's own `DomainPackageDetails`; both lists answer from that same
//!    record, so the three cannot disagree.
//! 3. The association is `ASSOCIATING` for a non-zero span and then settles on
//!    `ACTIVE`, and no read moves it.
//! 4. Each list reports only the associations of the resource it names, in a
//!    stable order, and `MaxResults`/`NextToken` page that set.
//! 5. A package or a domain the Region does not hold is not found.
