//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-chimesdkidentity-chimeidentityservice service.
//!
//! The `AppInstance` is this service's root resource: every other identity resource
//! (users, bots, admins, endpoints, retention settings) hangs off exactly one of them.
//! State is therefore a single `BTreeMap` of app instances keyed by ARN, with each
//! instance owning its users and its bots, plus three index maps:
//!
//! * `users_by_arn` — a user ARN to its owning instance ARN, because
//!   `DescribeAppInstanceUser` / `DeleteAppInstanceUser` are keyed only by the user ARN.
//! * `bots_by_arn` — the same index for the bots an instance owns, because the bot
//!   operations are keyed only by the bot ARN.
//! * `idempotency` — a create operation's `ClientRequestToken` to the ARN that token
//!   already minted, so repeating one token never mints a second resource.
//!
//! An `AppInstanceUserEndpoint` is not addressed by an ARN of its own — every operation
//! on one names its owning user's ARN plus an `EndpointId` — so an endpoint is held in
//! its user's own `endpoints` map rather than in an index beside the two above, and the
//! deletion of a user (or of the instance that cascades to it) takes its endpoints with
//! it. For the same reason the register token that minted an endpoint lives ON the
//! endpoint record rather than in `idempotency`, which maps a token to an ARN.
//!
//! `BTreeMap` (not `HashMap`) everywhere: list operations page in key order, so the
//! iteration order has to be stable for a `NextToken` to be resumable.
//!
//! Two things this service reads are NOT in the struct below, because another Chime
//! service reads or writes them too and the engine keys state by type: the app-instance
//! ADMIN directory ([`app_instance_admins`]) and the family's ARN-keyed TAG directory
//! ([`chime_tags`]). A third, the family's identity NAME directory
//! ([`identity_names`]), is one this service WRITES for a sibling to read: the name an
//! `AppInstanceUser` or `AppInstanceBot` carries is reported by Chime SDK Messaging on
//! every channel participant, which cannot see the records below.
