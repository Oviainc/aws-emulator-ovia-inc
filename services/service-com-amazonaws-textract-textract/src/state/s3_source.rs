//! Where the BYTES of a submitted document come from: the request's own inline `Bytes`,
//! or the object Amazon S3 holds at the location it named.
//!
//! Textract takes a document "as base64-encoded bytes or an Amazon S3 object"
//! (`DetectDocumentText`'s `Document` member), and an asynchronous `Start*` takes nothing
//! else: a `DocumentLocation` is an S3 object only. So half of this service's input
//! surface is an object of the object store, and this emulator holds an Amazon S3 of its
//! own — reached the way any emulated service reaches another, through the operation
//! callback ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext::callback`]), which routes IN
//! PROCESS: no socket, no outbound request, no host resolution. An object a caller staged
//! with `PutObject` is therefore the object Textract reads, and once its bytes are here
//! they are decoded and recognised exactly like inline bytes
//! ([`super::read_content`]) — one document answers the same whichever way it was
//! submitted.
//!
//! ## What grounds a refusal
//!
//! `InvalidS3ObjectException` says Textract "is unable to access the S3 object that's
//! specified in the request", so it is answered only for an object the store really did
//! not serve, and the two ways that happens are kept apart:
//!
//! * Amazon S3 ANSWERED that there is no such bucket, key or version, or that the read is
//!   not permitted ([`UNREADABLE_OBJECT_CODES`]) — a fact about the request, so an
//!   asynchronous submit is refused with it and no job is created
//!   ([`DocumentBytes::Established`]);
//! * nothing answered the read at all — this emulator was assembled with no object store
//!   to ask — so nothing about the object is established: a synchronous read answers the
//!   modelled error (it has no result to give), while an asynchronous job is created and
//!   ends in the modelled `FAILED` state carrying the reason
//!   ([`DocumentBytes::Unestablished`]).
//!
//! HOW MUCH IS READ IS BOUNDED, and bounded twice: the published ceiling for a document
//! ([`super::MAX_S3_DOCUMENT_BYTES`]) is checked against the length Amazon S3's own answer
//! DECLARES before a byte of the body is taken into this process, and the bytes are
//! checked against it again by [`super::read_content`], so an answer that declared no
//! length cannot get past it either.
