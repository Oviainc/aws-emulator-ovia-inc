//! End-to-end HTTP tests for WHAT the AWS-managed `aws.events` catalogue contains and
//! what it reports about each member:
//!
//! 1. a source the catalogue publishes CloudTrail-delivered schemas for publishes the
//!    whole family, not the API-call event alone, and every member of it is named
//!    after its `detail-type`;
//! 2. a published schema's `LastModified` is the SCHEMA's own instant — fixed, at
//!    whole-second precision and the same in every store — not a reading of the clock;
//! 3. a published schema's `VersionCount` is the number of versions the catalogue
//!    publishes for it, and every one of them is readable;
//! 4. a schema AWS publishes is no customer resource, so it carries no ARN;
//! 5. a published document titles the EVENT it describes, and the draft-04 export
//!    carries that title, the component the document roots at as its own root, every
//!    other component as a definition, and OpenAPI's `nullable` lowered to a draft-04
//!    type union.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path, through the harness in
//! `registry_schema_lifecycle.rs` — nothing here touches the state struct directly.
