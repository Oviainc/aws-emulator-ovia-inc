//! End-to-end cover for `CreateNetworkInterface` and `DescribeNetworkInterfaces`, driven
//! over the wire the service actually speaks: `ec2Query` — an
//! `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST whose body carries `Action=<Operation>`,
//! answered with XML (README.md / OPERATIONS.md "Wire protocol"). ec2Query is selected by
//! the `ec2` signing name in the request's SigV4 credential scope, so every call here
//! carries one.
//!
//! Two rules are under test.
//!
//! * `DescribeNetworkInterfaces` REPORTS THE STORE: the set it answers with is the
//!   account's network interfaces narrowed by the `NetworkInterfaceIds` and `Filters` the
//!   request names and cut into `MaxResults`-sized pages. A fresh account holds none, so
//!   the empty set is one row of that rule rather than a fixed answer — the tables below
//!   vary the filter (each documented name), the number of values and filters, the ids and
//!   the page size.
//! * `CreateNetworkInterface` stores an interface the describe then reports: its subnet,
//!   VPC, Availability Zone, security groups, description, type, tags and private IPv4
//!   addresses round-trip, and the addresses it takes leave the subnet's available count.
//!
//! The ceilings on the filtering work one describe can ask for are covered too: matching
//! cost is the PRODUCT of how many filters a request carries, how many values each
//! carries, how long a value is and how many interfaces the store holds, and the model
//! bounds none of them (`FilterList` and `Filter$Values` carry no `@length`), so a request
//! AT each of this crate's ceilings is answered while one PAST it is refused.
