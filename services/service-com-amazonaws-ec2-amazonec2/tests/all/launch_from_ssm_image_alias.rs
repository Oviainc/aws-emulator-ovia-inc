//! What a LAUNCH does with an `ImageId` that names a Systems Manager parameter, and the EBS
//! attachment lifecycle that launch feeds — driven over the ec2Query wire the service speaks,
//! through the crate's shared [`super::ec2_query`] harness.
//!
//! The rules under test are:
//!
//! 1. A LAUNCH RESOLVES A SYSTEMS MANAGER PARAMETER TO AN AMI ID: "alternatively, you can
//!    specify a Systems Manager parameter […] The Systems Manager parameter will resolve to an
//!    AMI ID on launch. To reference a public parameter: `resolve:ssm:public-parameter`"
//!    (`RequestLaunchTemplateData$ImageId`), so a launch given such a value runs from the AMI
//!    the parameter names and the instance reports THAT id — never the parameter. The rows are
//!    the whole published catalog, read out of the store rather than written here, so every
//!    name is covered rather than the one a request happened to carry;
//! 2. ONLY A VALUE THAT NAMES AN AMI DIRECTLY IS READ AS AN ID: such a value is still held to
//!    the issued-id form (`InvalidAMIID.Malformed`), while a parameter the account can see no
//!    image under names no AMI at all (`InvalidAMIID.NotFound`);
//! 3. THE EBS ATTACHMENT LIFECYCLE IS THE ONE PROJECTION OF ONE RECORD, end to end from such a
//!    launch: `AttachVolume` records the attachment, so `DescribeVolumes` reports the volume
//!    `in-use` with that attachment — `attaching` until the clock owes it `attached` — and the
//!    matching `DetachVolume` takes it down with 200 and reports it `detaching`;
//! 4. AN ATTACHMENT THE VOLUME DOES NOT HOLD IS NOT A STATE PROBLEM: a detach naming one
//!    answers `InvalidAttachment.NotFound`, whose message names the volume and whichever of the
//!    instance and the device the request gave.
//!
//! Each table row is a distinct input along what the rule generalises over — which published
//! parameter name, which form the `ImageId` value takes, which member of the detach selects an
//! attachment the volume does not hold — so no row is the specification.
