//! `DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings` end-to-end: which instance types a Region reports
//! as offered, in which locations, and how a caller narrows and pages them.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire the service actually speaks, through the shared
//! `super::ec2_query` harness: an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` ec2Query POST
//! dispatched through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the emulator serves with, carrying
//! the Region in the SigV4 `Credential=` scope, which is where the service reads the
//! Region it is being asked about.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! 1. A Region reports the instance types it offers in each location of the requested
//!    `LocationType`: the Region itself for `region` (the default when a request names
//!    none, where the whole modelled `InstanceType` catalog is offered), its Availability
//!    Zones for `availability-zone`, their AZ IDs for `availability-zone-id`, and nothing
//!    for `outpost`, because no operation of this emulator creates an Outpost. Not every
//!    zone offers every type — the Region's last zone offers only the previous generations
//!    — which is why the describe reports per location at all. A `LocationType` outside the
//!    modelled enum is refused.
//! 2. `Filters` (`instance-type`, `location`) are ANDed with one another and ORed over
//!    each filter's values, with EC2's `*` and `?` wildcards; a filter the operation
//!    does not document is refused with `InvalidParameterValue`.
//! 3. `MaxResults` and `NextToken` page the matching offerings: each page holds at most
//!    `MaxResults` items, the walk reports every matching offering exactly once, and
//!    the last page carries no token. A token this service did not mint is refused with
//!    `InvalidPaginationToken`, and `MaxResults` outside the modelled 5..1000 range is
//!    refused at the boundary.
//! 4. `DryRun` performs nothing and answers 412 `DryRunOperation`.
//! 5. The describe is a read: repeating it answers the same offerings.
//!
//! Offering ORDER within a response is deliberately not asserted — EC2 says the order
//! of elements in a response might vary — so every comparison here is over a sorted
//! set. What the pagination test does rely on is that the order is STABLE across
//! calls, which is what makes a cursor token see each offering exactly once.
