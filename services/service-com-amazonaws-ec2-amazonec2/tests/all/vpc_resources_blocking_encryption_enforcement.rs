//! End-to-end cover for `GetVpcResourcesBlockingEncryptionEnforcement`, driven over the
//! wire the service actually speaks: `ec2Query` — an
//! `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST whose body carries `Action=…`, answered with
//! XML (README.md / OPERATIONS.md "Wire protocol").
//!
//! The RULE under test: the report names every resource of the ONE VPC the request names
//! whose traffic VPC Encryption Control cannot encrypt — an instance whose instance type
//! does not automatically encrypt in-transit traffic
//! (`NetworkInfo$EncryptionInTransitSupported`), and a VPC attachment to a transit gateway
//! that does not support VPC Encryption Control
//! (`TransitGatewayOptions$EncryptionSupport`) — and nothing else; a VPC that holds none
//! is reported empty rather than refused, and a VPC the account does not have is refused
//! rather than reported empty.
//!
//! Each test is a TABLE whose rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the
//! instance TYPE (pre-Nitro generations, the named earlier types with encrypting adapters,
//! and the generations from which every type encrypts), the KIND of resource (an instance
//! and a transit gateway attachment), where the resource sits (this VPC, another VPC, a
//! subnet nothing minted, no subnet at all), the encryption state of a gateway (every
//! member of the modelled `EncryptionStateValue` enum and a gateway reporting none), the
//! state of an attachment, the page size at each published bound and one past it, and the
//! form of a `VpcId` or a `NextToken` that resolves to nothing — including a token this
//! service really minted, for another VPC's report.
