//! End-to-end cover for `AttachVolume`, driven over the wire the service actually speaks —
//! `ec2Query`, through the crate's shared [`super::ec2_query`] harness.
//!
//! The rules under test are:
//!
//! 1. AN ATTACH RECORDS THE ATTACHMENT ON THE VOLUME AND THE CLOCK BRINGS IT UP: the
//!    response is the attachment as the store now holds it — the volume, the instance, the
//!    device the request named, the EBS card index ("the default EBS card index is 0") and
//!    `deleteOnTermination` — in the non-terminal `attaching` state, which the clock, not a
//!    caller, moves to `attached`; the volume holds it from that moment, so it reports
//!    `in-use`, and `DescribeVolumes` reports the same projection;
//! 2. AN ATTACH IS ADMITTED ONLY BY THE REQUEST AND THE STATE BEHIND IT: "attaches an
//!    Amazon EBS volume to a running or stopped instance" in the same Availability Zone
//!    ("the volume and instance must be within the same Availability Zone",
//!    `AttachVolumeRequest$VolumeId`), at a device name the instance does not already hold a
//!    volume at — and each refusal carries EC2's own code for what is wrong, with nothing
//!    written;
//! 3. A MULTI-ATTACH ENABLED VOLUME IS HELD BY SEVERAL INSTANCES, up to the number the
//!    Amazon EBS User Guide publishes ([`MULTI_ATTACH_INSTANCE_LIMIT`]), and never twice by
//!    the same one;
//! 4. AN INSTANCE HOLDS AS MANY EBS VOLUMES AS ITS INSTANCE TYPE SUPPORTS: "if you exceed
//!    the volume attachment limit for an instance type, the attachment request fails with
//!    the AttachmentLimitExceeded error" — the limit being the type's own
//!    `EbsInfo$MaximumEbsAttachments`, which `DescribeInstanceTypes` publishes.
//!
//! Each table row is a distinct input along what the rule generalises over — which device
//! name, which EBS card index, which state the instance or the volume is in, which id form,
//! which instance type and so which limit — so no row is the specification.
