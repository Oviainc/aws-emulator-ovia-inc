//! * `registration_tokens` is what `ResolveCustomer` reads — a token is minted out
//!   of band (a buyer's browser hands it to the seller's site), so it is seeded into
//!   state and NEVER created by a lookup: a token that is not there is invalid.
//! * `products` is the seller's published catalog: the usage dimensions a product

//!   `InvalidProductCodeException`, `InvalidUsageDimensionException`,
//!   `CustomerNotEntitledException` / `CustomerNotSubscribed` and
//!   `InvalidPublicKeyVersionException` are decided from.
//! * `registrations` makes `RegisterUsage` stable: the signature is minted once per
//!   (product, public-key version, nonce) and read back on every later call.
//! * `metering_records` is the ledger `MeterUsage` and `BatchMeterUsage` both append
