//! A rate-based rule RECOVERS: what the edge decides once a caller's requests have
//! fallen out of the rule's evaluation window.
//!
//! The rule this suite pins: a rate-based rule counts a caller's requests per
//! aggregation instance and applies its action while that instance's count over the
//! `EvaluationWindowSec` immediately preceding THE INSTANT OF THE CHECK is over the
//! `Limit` — "the amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should include in its request
//! counts, looking back from the current time"
//! (`smithy_query(query="doc",shape="RateBasedStatement",member="EvaluationWindowSec")`).
//! So the window is a SLIDING one, measured from the call that reads it, and a caller
//! whose counted requests all lie further back than the window is under the limit again
//! and is served. The same arithmetic decides what `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys`
//! lists, so a key stops being reported at the instant the rule stops acting on it.
//!
//! TWO tables, because the window has two things to pin and they are measured against
//! different instants:
//!
//! * [`a_rate_based_rule_serves_the_caller_again_once_its_window_has_passed`] drives the
//!   whole path — the data plane's own entry point
//!   ([`service_com_amazonaws_wafv2_awswaf_20190729::service::edge::decide`]) on the
//!   SAME shared engine the service is mounted on, and the managed keys read over the
//!   wire — for every window a rate-based statement can look back over ("Valid settings
//!   are 60, 120, 300, and 600", the same member), against how far back the caller's
//!   counted requests lie: inside the window, far into it, and past it. Time is not
//!   waited for; the recorded per-second counts are PLACED at a chosen second before the
//!   current one, which is what the passage of that much time does to the window they
//!   are read through.
//! * [`the_evaluation_window_counts_the_seconds_it_names`] pins the window's EDGE, where
//!   the instant has to be exact: the counting both readers above share takes that
//!   instant as a parameter, so the table names it rather than reading the clock.
//!
//! The split is itself the rule at work. The window is measured from the instant of each
//! CHECK, which for a call is necessarily later than any state the suite placed for it,
//! so a row whose expected answer changes within a second of the placement cannot be
//! asserted across a call at all: it would hold only while the suite stayed inside the
//! wall-clock second it placed the counts in. The rows driven through the service
//! therefore sit well inside the window or past it, and the edge is pinned where the
//! instant is a parameter.
