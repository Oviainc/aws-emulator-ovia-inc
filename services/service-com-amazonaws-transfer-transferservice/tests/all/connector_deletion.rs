//! `DeleteConnector` over the class of stored connectors.
//!
//! RULE under test: `DeleteConnector` RELEASES the stored connector its `ConnectorId`
//! names and nothing else — the deleted id is afterwards unknown to every reader of a
//! connector (`DescribeConnector`, `ListConnectors`, `StartFileTransfer`) and the store
//! capacity it held is free again, while every other stored connector reads back
//! unchanged; a `ConnectorId` the store does not hold (never created, or already
//! deleted) is answered with this service's not-found error and changes nothing.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the protocol configuration of
//! the connector deleted (AS2 or SFTP), its egress type (service-managed or VPC
//! Lattice), whether it carries tags and optional members, how many connectors the
//! store holds beside it, its position in `ConnectorId` order (first, middle, last),
//! and — for the refusals — where the absent id sits in the id space.
//!
//! Every call goes over the real wire path through the shared [`crate::harness`], so
//! what is asserted is what an SDK sees.
