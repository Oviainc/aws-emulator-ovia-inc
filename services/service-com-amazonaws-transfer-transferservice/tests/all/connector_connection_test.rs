//! What `TestConnection` answers for a stored connector.
//!
//! Three rules, each asserted over a TABLE of connectors rather than one recorded call:
//!
//! 1. testing a stored SFTP connector answers HTTP 200 carrying the connector's own id
//!    and the verdict its STORED configuration earns: `Status` at the operation's
//!    documented failure value, a `StatusMessage` naming the first defect that
//!    configuration carries — no secret to authenticate with, no trusted host key, or a
//!    trusted host key that is not an SSH public key — or, when it carries none, saying
//!    the connection itself was never verified, and NO `SftpConnectionDetails`, because
//!    the remote server's host key is only ever observed on a connection
//!    ([`testing_an_sftp_connector_reports_the_verdict_its_configuration_earns`]). The
//!    same suite asserts the text is FIXED per condition (no identifier, secret or key
//!    body reaches it) and that a test is a pure read: it answers the same thing twice
//!    and leaves the described connector unchanged;
//! 2. a connector that configures no SFTP connection has none for this call to test, so
//!    it is refused with the modelled `InvalidRequestException`
//!    ([`testing_a_connector_that_configures_no_sftp_connection_is_refused`]);
//! 3. a `ConnectorId` the store does not hold answers this service's generic not-found
//!    error ([`testing_a_connector_that_was_never_created_is_not_found`]).
//!
//! The rows differ along what each rule generalises over: which member of the stored
//! SFTP configuration is missing or unusable, the FORM of the missing value (absent, or
//! present but blank/empty), the number and ORDER of trusted host keys, the key TYPE
//! (`ssh-ed25519` and `ssh-rsa`, both encoded here by the OpenSSH key-format crate), the
//! egress type (service-managed with a URL, VPC Lattice without one), and where the
//! probe id sits in the id space. The harness (router, request signing) is the shared
//! [`crate::harness`].
