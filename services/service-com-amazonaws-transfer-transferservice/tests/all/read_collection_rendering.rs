//! How a READ renders the collections a resource holds, and how it tags the elements of
//! a workflow's step lists.
//!
//! RULE 1: a member reporting a collection the resource ALWAYS holds — its tag set, a
//! profile's attached certificate ids, a workflow's two step lists — is always
//! serialised, as the EMPTY list when that collection is empty, because "the resource
//! holds none" and "the member was not reported" are different answers and a caller
//! that reads the member unconditionally must get the first one. A member reporting an
//! optional setting the resource does NOT have (a workflow's log destination) stays
//! absent, which is what makes those two answers distinguishable at all.
//!
//! RULE 2: each element of a `WorkflowSteps` list is rendered with a type discriminator
//! naming the element's own shape, alongside the step's modelled members — a list
//! element only, so neither the enclosing workflow nor the step's own `*StepDetails`
//! structure carries one.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rules generalise over: the resource KIND the read
//! addresses (every kind this service stores a tag set for, plus the two readers whose
//! other collection members this covers), the SIZE of the collection (none, one, three,
//! and a workflow's whole modelled `len 0..8` step range), the step TYPE each element
//! carries, and which of the two step lists the element sits in.
//!
//! Every request goes over the real wire path (`POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: TransferService.<Op>`) through the shared [`crate::harness`], so what
//! is asserted is what an SDK sees rather than what a handler returns.
