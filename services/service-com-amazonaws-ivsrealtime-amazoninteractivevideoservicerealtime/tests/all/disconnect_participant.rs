//! `DisconnectParticipant` end to end: what the emulator does to the participant an id
//! names in the stage an ARN names.
//!
//! Every case goes through the router's own `dispatch` with a restJson1 request, exactly
//! as a signed `aws ivs-realtime disconnect-participant` call arrives, so what is asserted
//! is the emulator's HTTP behaviour and never a handler called directly.
//!
//! The RULES under test, each exercised over a SET of inputs rather than on one request:
//!
//! 1. A disconnect takes the named participant OUT of the stage it is attached to: its
//!    record stays in the session and reports `DISCONNECTED`, every other participant of
//!    that session is untouched, and a session the departure empties ends (the stage
//!    reports no active session again). The answer is the modelled 200 carrying no
//!    member, and a second disconnect of the same participant changes nothing further.
//! 2. "If the participant is publishing using an IngestConfiguration,
//!    DisconnectParticipant also updates the stageArn in the IngestConfiguration to be an
//!    empty string": the configuration the disconnected participant was publishing with
//!    is left associated with no stage, so a read of it reports the empty `stageArn` and
//!    `INACTIVE`. A configuration the disconnected participant was NOT publishing with
//!    keeps its stage.
//! 3. A request naming a stage this account does not hold is the modelled
//!    `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) and writes nothing; a value outside a
//!    member's modelled `@pattern` / `@length` is the modelled `ValidationException`
//!    (HTTP 400). A well-formed `participantId` the resolved stage holds no connection for
//!    is NOT a refusal: there is nothing to disconnect, so the call answers the modelled
//!    200 carrying no member and writes nothing — the disconnect is idempotent.
//!
//! Nothing in the IVS RealTime control plane makes a participant JOIN a stage: a
//! participant joins over the stage's data plane with the participant token or ingest key
//! it was issued, which is `state::join_stage_session` — the one place a participant
//! record is created. So these cases bring participants into a session through it,
//! reaching the store through this suite's own engine handle, exactly as the
//! `ListParticipants` and `DeleteIngestConfiguration` suites beside this one do.
