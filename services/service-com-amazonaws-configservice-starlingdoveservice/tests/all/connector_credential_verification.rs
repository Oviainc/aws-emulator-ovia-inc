//! What `PutConnector` answers a provider configuration, end to end over the wire.
//!
//! Three rules are pinned here, each over a TABLE of configurations rather than one
//! recorded case:
//!
//! 1. a `ConnectorConfiguration` that names no provider is refused with the modelled
//!    `ValidationException` and the one fixed structural text, whatever way it fails
//!    to name one;
//! 2. a provider identifier whose FORM is not the provider's own — an Azure tenant or
//!    client identifier is a GUID in its canonical hyphenated form — is refused with
//!    `ValidationException` naming the identifier that is not one, before any
//!    credential is used;
//! 3. a well-formed provider configuration is refused because its credentials cannot
//!    be verified WITH the provider: a connector IS the credential Config connects
//!    with, so the tenant/client pair is verified before anything is materialized, and
//!    verifying it means calling the provider's identity service — an outbound
//!    connection this emulator does not make. Nothing is created by any of the three:
//!    no ARN comes back, the connector is readable nowhere and no listing reports it,
//!    and the refusal happens BEFORE the conflict and quota legs this operation also
//!    models.
//!
//! The harness (`Emulator`) is the one `config_setup_and_rule_loop` builds; every case
//! drives the emulator the way a client does, through the `MultiServiceRouter`. The
//! connectors a case needs in state are seeded through `service_state`
//! (`config_connectors::seed_connector`), the way the other suites of this crate seed
//! state, because `PutConnector` creates none.
