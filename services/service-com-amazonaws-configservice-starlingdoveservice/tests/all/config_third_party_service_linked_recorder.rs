//! `PutThirdPartyServiceLinkedConfigurationRecorder`, end to end over the wire.

//! Every case drives the emulator the way a client does — an `awsJson1_1` `POST /`
//! through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router builds — and asserts
//! what the service PERSISTED, by reading the recorder back through
//! `DescribeConfigurationRecorders` and `DescribeConfigurationRecorderStatus`.
//!
//! The rules pinned here, each over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded case:
//!
//! 1. a service principal that names no Amazon Web Services service, and one that
//!    names a service Config records no third-party cloud service provider for, are
//!    both refused with `ValidationException` and persist nothing, however well formed
//!    they are;
//! 2. a supported service principal creates the recorder the linked service manages:
//!    the name Config derives from that service, the recording configuration the
//!    linked service sets, and the scope of third-party resources the request asked
//!    for, all read back out of state;
//! 3. the scope configuration must satisfy its own published constraints;
//! 4. the connector the recorder is linked to must exist;
//! 5. a repeat call for the same principal and connector updates the scope, while a
//!    different connector for the same principal conflicts;
//! 6. a service-linked recorder is always recording and is not this account's
//!    customer managed recorder.
//!
//! The connector the recorder links to is created over the wire with `PutConnector`,
//! like every other step.
