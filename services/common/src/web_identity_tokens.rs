//! The web identity tokens this emulator ITSELF issued: the registry the service that
//! REDEEMS one reads, written by the service that ISSUED it.
//!
//! A web identity token is a bearer of an identity, and the two halves of its life live in
//! two different services: Amazon Cognito Identity mints one (`GetOpenIdToken`,
//! `GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity`), and STS is handed it back by a client that wants
//! credentials for it (`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`). The redeemer's whole question is
//! whether the token is one it can trust — against AWS that is answered by verifying the
//! token's signature with the key its issuer publishes at the issuer's own key-set
//! endpoint, which this emulator does not fetch, because it makes no request outside
//! itself.
//!
//! What it CAN answer is whether the token is one it issued, and that is what this registry
//! holds: one record per issued token, naming the issuer, the audience and the subject the
//! issuing call recorded, plus the window the issuance is valid in. So the registry is the
//! shared type the ManagementEventLog is — held once in the one engine both services reach,
//! rather than as a second copy in either service's own state, because a token recorded in
//! one place and looked for in another is a token nobody can redeem.
//!
//! No secret lives here: a token IS its own bearer credential, and a registry keyed BY the
//! token stores nothing about it the holder does not already have. It is bounded twice, as
//! every request-driven store in this tree is — by the expiry of each record and by
//! [`MAX_ISSUED_TOKENS`] — and both bounds are materialised on the WRITE path, so a read
//! never changes what a later read sees.
