//! The ONE reading of WHERE a JSON document a caller submitted stopped parsing.
//!
//! Several AWS services take a JSON document as an opaque string member — an IAM policy
//! document, a message filter policy — and refuse one they cannot parse with their JSON
//! parser's own diagnostic rather than with a restatement of the member's type. Those
//! diagnostics all say the same things: what the parse stopped ON, what a value could have
//! been there instead, the line and column it stopped at, and — for a document that ran out
//! of input inside a collection — where that collection opened. The SENTENCE each service
//! frames them in is its own (the services differ in what they prefix and in which fault
//! classes they report), but the readings are the same question about the same document, so
//! they are stated once here: two services handed the same document cannot disagree about
//! where it went wrong.
//!
//! Everything here derives from [`serde_json::Error`], which is the parse that actually ran:
//! `line()` and `column()` are where it stopped, and its rendered cause is why. The one
//! reading the parse does not carry — the mark of the container it was still inside — is
//! read off the document itself ([`unclosed_container_start`]), for the fault class the
//! parse has already named; nothing re-scans a document looking for a likely fault.
//!
//! The reported position is ONE-based, and a column counts BYTES from the start of its line,
//! which is the convention the parser reports in.
