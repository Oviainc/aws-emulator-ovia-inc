//! How a service states the framework's boundary refusal of a request.
//!
//! The framework hands a service the refusal STRUCTURALLY — `Refusal::Invalid` holding
//! one [`Violation`] per constraint the request broke — and lets the service choose the
//! words, because no model records them. [`aws_validation_refusal`] is the wording AWS
//! itself uses, so a service only has to delegate to it.
//!
//! The ONE thing AWS words differently from the framework is how a `@pattern` requirement
//! is quoted, and that rendering is NOT implemented here: it is
//! [`crate::validation::unanchored`], this crate's staged home for it, which every service
//! carrying its own inlined copy is to migrate onto. This module only decides WHICH
//! violations get restated and in what envelope. The envelope itself, the member paths and
//! every other requirement are the framework's, so nothing about them can drift per crate.
//!
//! The rendering rule is framework-level — it belongs in
//! `vendor/smithy-schema-server/src/constraints.rs`'s `Violation::requirement`, which a fix
//! may not change from here; once it learns this, delete this module and every
//! `override_refusal` that delegates to it.

///
/// This is the whole `Service::override_refusal` body for a service on a JSON protocol
/// (restJson1 or the awsJson family), where AWS answers a constraint refusal as
/// `400 ValidationException` with the envelope
/// `N validation error(s) detected: Value '<value>' at '<member path>' failed to satisfy
/// constraint: <requirement>` — the envelope the framework already renders, except that
/// AWS quotes a `@pattern` requirement without the anchors a whole-value pattern wraps it
/// in ([`crate::validation::unanchored`]). The check itself still uses the model's pattern
/// as written: only the RENDERING drops them. Every other requirement, and the member
/// path, are the framework's, so the two cannot drift.
///
/// `None` for anything that is not a constraint refusal (an unauthenticated caller keeps
/// the framework's 403 code and wording), and `None` when there is nothing to state.
///
/// A service on a query protocol must not wire this in unchanged: the framework answers
/// a boundary refusal there as `MalformedQueryString`, so forcing the JSON code would
