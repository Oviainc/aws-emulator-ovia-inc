//! The FRONT DOOR an AWS REST service puts in front of its application code, as a
//! wrapper any service can serve its operations behind.
//!
//! # What a front door is
//!
//! Several AWS REST services validate a request's JSON BODY against the operation's
//! modelled input at a layer AHEAD of the code that owns the service's modelled
//! errors, and reject it there: HTTP 400 with the error code
//! [`BAD_REQUEST_EXCEPTION`] — a shape those services' models do not declare — and the
//! fixed sentence [`INVALID_REQUEST_BODY`], which names neither the member nor the
//! value. A constraint on a value bound to the request URI (`@httpLabel`,
//! `@httpQuery`) is NOT a body rejection: the service itself refuses those, as the
//! modelled validation error, naming what failed.
//!
//! # Why this cannot live in `Service::override_refusal`
//!
//! The framework refuses every modelled constraint before a handler runs and words
//! that refusal through [`smithy_server_runtime::Service::override_refusal`], which is
//! handed the violations ALONE — no operation, no request — so it cannot tell a body
//! violation from a URI one. Two operations of one service can even bind the same
//! member name both ways (a create carrying an ARN in the body, a read carrying it in
//! the path), so no rule over violation paths alone can place them.
//!
//! [`FrontDoor`] is where that distinction lives: a service serves each modelled
//! operation wrapped in it (through its `override_operation` seam), and the wrapper
//! reads the HTTP BINDING of each violated member off THAT operation's own input
//! schema.
//!
//! # Services still carrying their own copy
//!
//! This rule predates this module and is inlined in the service crates that needed it
//! before there was anywhere shared to put it —
//! `grep -rln 'fn binds_to_body\|fn body_bound\|fn is_bound_to_request' services/*/src/service.rs`
//! lists them (today: `networkmonitor`, `artifact`, `uxc`, `directoryservicedata`).
//! Those copies are to be MIGRATED onto this module; they are left in place only
//! because this change does not own those services' issues, and each is covered by its
//! own suite. Nothing new should inline the rule again — call this module.
//!
//! # Two wordings
//!
//! Most front doors answer the one fixed sentence above. Some report, in brackets, the
//! CLAUSE their body-schema validator states for each constraint class it found — the
//! regex a value does not match, the length bound a string broke. That is the only thing
//! a service chooses here: [`FrontDoor::worded`] takes a [`BodyWording`] built from the
//! sentences in [`crate::validation_message`], so the sentences themselves still cannot
//! drift per crate.
//!
//! # The other half: a value bound to the URI
//!
//! A constraint broken by a value the request carries OUTSIDE its body is not a body
//! rejection, so a front door leaves it to the layers behind the door by default — the
//! framework's walk, worded through `Service::override_refusal`. A service that words
//! such a refusal PER OPERATION cannot word it there either, and for the same reason the
//! body half cannot: a service-level seam is handed the violations alone, so two
//! operations refusing the same member name are indistinguishable to it — and AWS does
//! word them differently, one operation to the next. [`FrontDoor::wording_uri`] is where
//! that choice lives: the wording is attached to ONE wrapped operation, so the sentence
//! belongs to the operation that raised the refusal.
