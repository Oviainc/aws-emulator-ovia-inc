//! End-to-end tests for the MESSAGE every `Update*` operation that takes
//! `patchOperations` refuses a patch path it cannot apply with.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees, not what a handler returns. The emulator and the per-resource create and read
//! helpers are this crate's existing harness.
//!
//! The RULE under test: a patch path such an operation cannot apply is refused with a
//! `BadRequestException` (HTTP 400) whose message quotes the rejected path, names the `op`
//! of the same `patchOperations` entry and enumerates the paths that resource publishes for
//! THAT op — or, for an op it publishes no path for, tells the caller to choose one it
//! supports — and where the pointer reaches into a NESTED structure the service validates
//! on its own, the structure's own sentence names that member and enumerates its full
//! pointers instead. An `op` the resource takes no path at all for is refused as an op,
//! with the resource's own enumeration of the ops it does take.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over rather than repeating one call: the
//! OPERATION (and so the resource and its published list), the op that named the path, and
//! the FORM of the unapplicable path — a member no shape declares, a member the service
//! assigns, a pointer reaching into a single-valued member, a path that is no JSON Pointer,
//! an empty path. Each published list is pinned from the other side too: a path it names is
//! accepted for that resource and reads back through the resource's own reader.
//!
//! `UpdateApiKey` publishes a DIFFERENT list per op and has its own suite
//! (`update_api_key_patch_path_refusal`); the operations that answer with the bare
//! unaddressable-path sentence are covered by `refusal_message_constants` and
//! `patch_updates`.
