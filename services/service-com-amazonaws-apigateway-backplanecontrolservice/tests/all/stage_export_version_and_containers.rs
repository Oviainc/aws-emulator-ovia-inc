//! End-to-end tests for what an exported definition SAYS ABOUT ITSELF: the version the
//! downloaded file is named for, and the containers each OpenAPI dialect always writes.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees, not what a handler returns. The emulator, the `export` request builder and the
//! `CreateRestApi`/`PutMethod`/`CreateDeployment` helpers are this crate's existing
//! harness, reused from `rest_api_lifecycle`, `stage_export` and
//! `execute_api_data_plane`.
//!
//! The rules these cases assert, each over a SET of inputs rather than one recorded call:
//!
//! * the attachment is named for the export type and the VERSION of the definition it
//!   carries — the same version the document's own `info` states — so two exports of one
//!   stage download the same file name;
//! * an OpenAPI 3.0 document carries its Components Object and every Response Object's
//!   `content` map whether or not anything was put in them, while the 2.0 dialect, which
//!   has neither container, carries neither.
//!
//! The rows differ along the API's `version` (set, set to another form, and absent, where
//! the definition is identified by its deployment instead), along the dialect, along the
//! serialization the `Accept` header asks for, and along how many method responses a
//! method declares.
