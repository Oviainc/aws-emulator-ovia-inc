//! End-to-end tests for `UpdateStage`: applying `patchOperations` to a stored `Stage`
//! (`PATCH /restapis/{restApiId}/stages/{stageName}`).
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees, not what a handler returns. The emulator, the request builder and the
//! `CreateRestApi` / `CreateDeployment` / `GetStage` helpers are this crate's existing
//! harness, reused from `rest_api_lifecycle` and `stage_lifecycle`.
//!
//! The rules under test, each over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded call:
//!
//! * a supported `path` sets the member of the stored stage that the JSON Pointer names,
//!   and the stage reads back through `GetStage` exactly as the update reported it —
//!   asserted over the single-valued members, the `variables` map, the `canarySettings`
//!   and `accessLogSettings` structures and the per-method settings;
//! * a value outside a member's published value set or range, a path the `Stage` shape
//!   has no updateable member for, and an op a member does not support are each refused,
//!   and a refusal leaves the record exactly as it was;
//! * enabling, resizing and disabling the stage's cache cluster are transitions the CLOCK
//!   owes, observable as `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` / `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` until their span has
//!   passed;
//! * a method path that has no settings yet takes API Gateway's documented defaults for
//!   the settings the patch did not name.
