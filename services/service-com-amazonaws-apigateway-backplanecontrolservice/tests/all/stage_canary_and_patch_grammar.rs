//! End-to-end tests for a `Stage`'s CANARY RELEASE and for the grammar its
//! `patchOperations` are read by: which op reaches which pointer, and how a value is read.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees. The emulator and the `CreateRestApi` / `CreateDeployment` / `GetStage` helpers are
//! this crate's existing harness.
//!
//! The rules under test, each over a TABLE of inputs rather than one call:
//!
//! * a deployment created WITH canary settings for a stage the API already has is the
//!   CANARY's deployment: the stage keeps serving the deployment it points at, and
//!   promoting the canary is what makes its deployment, and its variable overrides, the
//!   stage's;
//! * a canary configured on a stage always serves a deployment, so one carrying none of
//!   its own serves the deployment the stage serves;
//! * the stage's cache capacity is stored as the request spells it;
//! * an access-log DESTINATION is named by an ARN, and the access-log FORMAT is not a part
//!   of a stage a `remove` takes away on its own, which is read as a method setting's path;
//! * a `remove` of a method setting takes it away and one the stage carries no settings for
//!   is refused;
//! * an `add` names one entry of a collection a stage keys by name and nothing else;
//! * a boolean member of a stage is true only when the patch value spells `true`.
