//! The `execute-api` data plane NAMES THE REQUEST it answered: every response a deployed
//! REST API stage serves carries the id of that request in the response header API Gateway
//! reports it in, so a client holding a response can correlate it with what the API
//! processed (its access-log and execution-log records, a support case, a trace).
//!
//! The rule asserted here is about the RESPONSE, not about any particular id: an id is
//! minted per request and no value is ever a requirement, so what every row checks is that
//! the header is THERE, that it has the shape every AWS request id has, and that two
//! responses never report one id. The rows differ along what the rule generalises over —
//! the outcome class (an integration served in full, each refusal class the data plane
//! answers, a server-side configuration fault), the addressing (the api's own invoke host
//! and the reserved data-plane path prefix), the verb, and whether the request carried a
//! SigV4 credential (which decides WHICH of the two seams serves it) — because the rule
//! holds for every response the endpoint serves, not for the successful ones.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path: an HTTP request through the multi-service router
//! into the mounted service, with the control plane driven through the same emulator
//! ([`Gateway`], this crate's one wire-test harness), so nothing here reaches into state.
