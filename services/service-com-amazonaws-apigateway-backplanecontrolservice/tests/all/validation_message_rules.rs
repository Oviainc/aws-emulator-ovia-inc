//! How this service STATES a request that breaks a modelled constraint, asserted on the
//! wire.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees, not what a handler returns. The emulator and the request builder are this
//! crate's existing harness, reused from `rest_api_lifecycle`.
//!
//! The RULE under test, which is this service's and not one operation's: a refused
//! request is answered HTTP 400 `ValidationException` — the CONSTRAINT layer's own error
//! class, not the operation's modelled `BadRequestException` — whose message names the
//! offending value, the member's path ROOTED AT THE OPERATION'S INPUT SHAPE
//! (`<operation>Input` in lowerCamel), and the constraint it failed — with a `@pattern`
//! emitted without the whole-value anchors the public model adds, and an enum value set
//! listed in the order the service declares the enum in. The ONE member this service
//! checks itself ahead of that layer (`CreateAuthorizer$type`) carries the operation's own
//! `BadRequestException` and the operation's own SENTENCE for that member instead, which is
//! the exception the last table below pins.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over rather than repeating one recorded call:
//! seven different operations (so the root is shown to be derived per operation, not a
//! constant), four constraint classes (an enum value set, a `@pattern`, an absent
//! required member, several violations at once), both HTTP bindings a violated member
//! can have (a body member and a URI label), and a nested member at two different list
//! positions.
