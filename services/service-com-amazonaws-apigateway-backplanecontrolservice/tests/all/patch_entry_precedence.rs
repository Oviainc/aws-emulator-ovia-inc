//! End-to-end tests for the ORDER one `patchOperations` entry is judged in, and for the
//! sentences each verdict is worded with.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees, not what a handler returns. The emulator, the request builder and the per-resource
//! create and read helpers are this crate's existing harness.
//!
//! The RULES under test:
//!
//! * the PATH is judged before the op. An operation that words a refusal of an
//!   unapplicable patch path by the path alone answers every op within `add`/`replace`/
//!   `remove` that the member the path names cannot take with that same path sentence, and
//!   the same path under the op the member DOES take is applied — so the refusal is about
//!   the (op, path) pair, not the path;
//! * an `op` outside those three — `move`, `copy` and `test`, which name nothing on these
//!   resources — is refused as an OP, in one fixed sentence that enumerates the three a
//!   path can ride in on, whichever resource and whichever path it was sent to;
//! * a gateway response's `statusCode` is not reachable by a patch at all, under any op:
//!   it is set by `PutGatewayResponse`, and the two string-to-string maps are what a patch
//!   edits;
//! * a request value outside an enum's value set is refused by the constraint layer in
//!   front of the operation, naming the member by its path from the operation's input
//!   shape — except a member bound to the QUERY STRING, which is named alone — and listing
//!   the set in the order the service declares the enum in;
//! * a stage reads every pointer that is no member of its own shape as a per-method
//!   setting's path, so it refuses one with that sentence and with the whole set of
//!   pointers it publishes.
//!
//! Each rule is asserted over a TABLE spanning what it generalises over: the operation (and
//! so the resource), the member and its kind, the op, and the form of the path.
