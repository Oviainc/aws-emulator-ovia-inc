//! The SENTENCE and the ERROR CLASS each refusal of this control plane carries, asserted
//! on the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees, not what a handler returns. The emulator and the request builder are this
//! crate's existing harness, reused from `rest_api_lifecycle`.
//!
//! The RULES under test, one per table:
//!
//! * a value outside the modelled `AuthorizerType` set is the operation's own
//!   `BadRequestException` carrying API Gateway's fixed sentence for that member, wherever
//!   the member is written — the create's boundary check and `UpdateAuthorizer`'s patch of
//!   `/type` alike — and not the constraint layer's envelope;
//! * an authorizer whose `type` authorizes by CALLING a Lambda and that carries no
//!   `authorizerUri` is refused with the fixed sentence naming that field as required,
//!   whichever call left it out;
//! * a `stageName` the addressed API already has a stage under is the fixed conflict
//!   sentence, which names neither the stage nor the API;
//! * a second non-private `CreateDomainName` under one `domainName` is the 400
//!   `BadRequestException` carrying the fixed sentence for an existing domain name, NOT a
//!   409;
//! * a `contentType` that is not a media type is refused with the fixed text, a colon and
//!   the offending value;
//! * a `targetArns` entry a VPC-link create cannot read as an ARN is refused with the
//!   not-well-formed sentence and the offending value;
//! * a `DeleteVpcLink` an integration still reaches is refused with the link's ID and the
//!   blocking reference as the `[RESTApiId:Method:Resource]` triple.
//!
//! Each table spans what its rule generalises over — the FORM of the rejected value, WHICH
//! call wrote the member, which type requires it, where the offending entry sits in a list,
//! which resource and verb hold the blocking reference — rather than one recorded request.
