//! How this service STATES a `restApiId` that names no stored API, asserted on the wire.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees, not what a handler returns. The emulator, the request builder and the
//! `CreateRestApi` / `CreateResource` helpers are this crate's existing harness, reused
//! from `rest_api_lifecycle`.
//!
//! The RULE under test, which is this service's and not one operation's: an API Gateway
//! operation whose own target is the API — the REST API record itself, a collection of it,
//! or an API an input member REFERENCES — states an identifier it cannot resolve back,
//! qualified by the account the lookup ran in —
//! `Invalid API identifier specified <accountId>:<restApiId>` — so the sentence is built
//! from the request and is the same whichever operation resolved the identifier and
//! whichever error class that operation models for the failure.
//!
//! Where the rule STOPS: a call addressed by a record NESTED under the API — a stage of
//! it, a resource of it — resolves that record by its whole key in one lookup and reports
//! THAT record instead, which `nested_record_refusals` asserts.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over rather than repeating one recorded call:
//! fourteen operations that resolve a `restApiId` (so the sentence is shown not to be one
//! handler's), a set of unknown identifiers differing in length, alphabet and case (so
//! the identifier is shown to be quoted from the request rather than fixed), both
//! bindings the identifier arrives on (a URI label and a body member), and both error
//! classes an operation models for it (the `NotFoundException` of a read or a write, and
//! the `BadRequestException` `CreateRestApi` models for `cloneFrom`, which models no
//! `NotFoundException`).
