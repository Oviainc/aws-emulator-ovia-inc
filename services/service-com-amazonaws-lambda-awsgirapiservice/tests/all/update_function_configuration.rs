//! `UpdateFunctionConfiguration` end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! The rule under test: an update of a function's configuration replaces the stored
//! value of EVERY setting the request names, leaves every setting it omits exactly as it
//! was, mints a new `RevisionId` and a new `LastModified` for the unpublished (`$LATEST`)
//! configuration it leaves behind, and reports what it persisted — so a later
//! `GetFunctionConfiguration` answers the same thing. It touches only the unpublished
//! version, it refuses a name qualified with a published version or an alias (400), a
//! function it holds no record of (404), a `RevisionId` that is not the stored one (412),
//! and a function that cannot be modified yet because it is still being created or
//! because an update of it is still in flight (409).
//!
//! Every row builds its function through the real `CreateFunction` over HTTP and reads
//! the result back through the real `GetFunctionConfiguration`, so a hardcoded answer
//! fails. The clock-driven halves — the `Pending` -> `Active` move `CreateFunction`
//! documents and the `InProgress` -> `Successful` move this operation documents — are
//! exercised by moving the stored due instants into the past, so nothing here sleeps.
