//! What `CreateEventSourceMapping` tells a caller whose request names the wrong SHAPE of
//! event source ARN or leaves out a member the source it named needs, and the processing
//! window a mapping on a shard source reports when its request stated none — over the wire,
//! read back through `GetEventSourceMapping` and `ListEventSourceMappings`.
//!
//! Three rules are asserted here, each over a table whose rows differ along what the rule
//! generalises over:
//!
//! 1. An `EventSourceArn` whose vendor namespace IS one of the source services that member
//!    enumerates ("Amazon Kinesis – The ARN of the data stream or a stream consumer", "Amazon
//!    DynamoDB Streams – The ARN of the stream", "Amazon Simple Queue Service – The ARN of
//!    the queue", "Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka – The ARN of the cluster …",
//!    "Amazon MQ – The ARN of the broker", "Amazon DocumentDB – The ARN of the DocumentDB
//!    change stream") but whose resource is not the shape that service's pollable resource is
//!    addressed by is refused with the modelled `InvalidParameterValueException` stating the
//!    ARN FORMAT expected for that source service, written for the Region the request was
//!    made in; an ARN of any other vendor names no source service at all, so the refusal
//!    lists the sources a mapping polls instead. The rows differ along the vendor, the
//!    resource type and the separator the resource field uses, the Region and account the
//!    value names, and include vendors outside that enumeration.
//!
//! 2. A member the model leaves OPTIONAL but this operation requires for the event source or
//!    the starting position the request names — `StartingPosition`, "Required for Amazon
//!    Kinesis and Amazon DynamoDB Stream event sources", and `StartingPositionTimestamp`,
//!    "With StartingPosition set to AT_TIMESTAMP, the time from which to start reading" — is
//!    refused, when absent, as the request validation error it is: AWS's envelope over that
//!    member's lowerCamel path. The rows differ along which member is absent, which source
//!    the mapping names (each source that needs it and sources that do not) and which
//!    starting position it asks for.
//!
//! 3. `TumblingWindowInSeconds` is "(Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) The duration in
//!    seconds of a processing window for DynamoDB and Kinesis Streams event sources. A value
//!    of 0 seconds indicates no tumbling window", so a mapping on one of those two sources
//!    whose request stated no window reports that duration — 0 — rather than no value, and a
//!    mapping on any other source reports the member not at all. The rows differ along the
//!    source, whether a window is stated, and the window's value: both published bounds of
//!    `@range(min: 0, max: 900)`, a value between them, and one past each bound.
//!
//! The member names, the per-source scopes and the range above are the model's own
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="com.amazonaws.lambda#EventSourceMappingConfiguration")`
//! and `smithy_query(query="doc", shape="CreateEventSourceMappingRequest",
//! member="EventSourceArn")`).
