//! The AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 a `nodejs*` runtime BUNDLES, imported as an ES module by a
//! handler that ships nothing of its own: Lambda, Amazon SQS and Amazon DynamoDB on ONE
//! engine, an `index.mjs` whose first lines are
//! `import { SQSClient, GetQueueUrlCommand, QueueDoesNotExist } from '@aws-sdk/client-sqs'`
//! and `import manifest from '@aws-sdk/client-sqs/package.json' with { type: 'json' }`, and
//! every probe it makes asserted against the service that answered it.
//!
//! The rule pinned here: AWS's managed Node.js runtimes ship the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 in
//! the execution environment, so a handler resolves an `@aws-sdk/*` package — and that
//! package's own `package.json` subpath — with nothing in the deployment package, and an ES
//! module's `import { … } from` of one binds the names that package exports: its client, a
//! command class per operation the service binds, and an error class per error shape it
//! declares. A refusal is thrown as an instance of the class the service's own error shape
//! names, which is the name a v3 client surfaces (the modelled Smithy name of the answer's
//! `__type`), with the answer's HTTP status in `$metadata`. A specifier the runtime cannot
//! resolve at all fails the initialization phase as `Runtime.ImportModuleError`.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which operation is called, whether
//! the service serves or refuses it, which error shape the refusal names, which package of
//! the SDK is imported, and which form an unresolvable specifier takes. No row states an
//! error code or a status of its own: for every refusal the handler's report is compared with
//! what the SAME request answers on the wire, so the names a JS consumer sees are the
//! emulated service's own.
