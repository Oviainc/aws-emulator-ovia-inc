//! The AWS SDK a RUNNING handler reaches AWS Step Functions through, end to end over the
//! wire: Lambda and Step Functions on ONE engine, a `python3.x` function whose code does
//! `import boto3`, and the execution it started read back where a client reads it.
//!
//! The rule pinned here: the AWS SDK a managed runtime supplies can build a client for any
//! AWS service the handler names, so a token naming a service THIS emulator serves is
//! signed, routed to that service's own endpoint and answered by that service's own API —
//! a success carrying the operation's own output members, or that service's own modelled
//! refusal raised as `botocore.exceptions.ClientError`. A client the runtime's SDK has no
//! registry entry for would instead raise `UnknownServiceError` before anything is signed,
//! which is not an answer any service gave; every row below asserts that it did not.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: WHICH operation of the service is
//! called (a write that starts an execution, a read of the state machine, a list of its
//! executions), WHICH token the client is built with (the SDK's own name for the service
//! and the service's SDK id), and whether the call succeeds or is refused — with three
//! different modelled refusals, each named by the resource the call could not be made on.
//! The write is then asserted on the STEP FUNCTIONS side too, through that service's own
//! API, so a call that answered without starting an execution fails here.
