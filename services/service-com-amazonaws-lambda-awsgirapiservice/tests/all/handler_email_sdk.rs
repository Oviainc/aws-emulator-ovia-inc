//! The AWS SDK a RUNNING handler reaches Amazon SES API v2 through, end to end over the
//! wire: Lambda and SES v2 on ONE engine, a `python3.x` function whose code does
//! `import boto3` and builds a client for the email service, and what each call did read
//! back where a client reads it.
//!
//! RULE: a managed runtime's bundled SDK can build a client for, and call, any service this
//! emulator serves, over that service's own protocol — so what a handler reads back is that
//! service's own answer (the operation's output members on a success, its own error code and
//! message raised as `botocore.exceptions.ClientError` on a refusal) and never a
//! client-side report that the service is unknown.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: WHICH binding class the operation
//! uses (a body-only create, a create whose output carries no member at all, a read
//! addressed by one path label, a read taking no input, a list bound to its own URI, a send
//! whose input nests several structures), and whether the call is served or refused — and,
//! for a refusal, which of the service's own error codes comes back. Each served row is
//! asserted on BOTH sides: what the guest read back, and what SES v2 itself holds, read
//! through its own API.
//!
//! The suite RUNS handlers, so it takes the target's one invocation stream
//! ([`crate::invoke_request_id::one_invocation_stream_at_a_time`]): this emulator serves at
//! most `MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` invocations at once for the whole process.
