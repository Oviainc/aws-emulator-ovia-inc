//! End-to-end tests for the durable execution an `Invoke` starts.
//!
//! The rule under test: an invocation this service ACCEPTS starts one durable execution
//! when it invokes a durable function — one whose resolved configuration carries a
//! `DurableConfig`, "Configuration settings for durable functions" — or when it names a
//! `DurableExecutionName`; the execution runs under the version the call resolved, is
//! named by the request or by a generated unique identifier ("If not specified, Lambda
//! generates a unique identifier automatically"), and the call answers the ARN it is
//! addressed by in `X-Amz-Durable-Execution-Arn` ("The ARN of the durable execution that
//! was started"). From that moment `ListDurableExecutionsByFunction` reports exactly that
//! execution. A second invocation reusing a live name starts no duplicate: with the same
//! payload it answers the execution already started, and with a different payload it is
//! refused `DurableExecutionAlreadyStartedException` (409). An invocation that starts no
//! execution answers no ARN at all.
//!
//! Every assertion is over real HTTP requests through the router — the invocation that
//! starts the execution, and the listing that reads it back — so an ARN that was never
//! persisted fails here. The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: whether
//! the function carries a `DurableConfig`, whether the request names an execution and
//! with what name (each published length bound, each character class the pattern admits),
//! the qualifier the call resolves ($LATEST, a published version, an alias), the payload,
//! and the invocation type.
