//! What a call against a comment whose content has been deleted is refused WITH:
//! the code AND the text of `CommentDeletedException`, over the wire, for every
//! operation that takes a `commentId`.
//!
//! The rule under test: a modelled exception carries the message the service is
//! recorded to produce for the operation that raised it — so
//! `CommentDeletedException` carries the fixed sentence pair "The specified comment
//! has already been marked as deleted." and "Verify that you specified a valid
//! comment ID, and then try again.", separated by the TWO spaces the recording
//! carries, led by a clause naming the refused action only for the
//! repeated `DeleteCommentContent` the corpus records that way, and never carrying
//! a value taken from the request. The deleted record is what decides this, so the
//! refusal does not depend on which comment it is, who is asking, or whether the
//! caller is the author; and being refused changes nothing about the stored
//! comment.
//!
//! The table below spans what the rule generalises over — the comment (content
//! kind and size, where it sits in the comparison, whether another principal had
//! reacted to it, which principal posted it), the operation that is refused, and
//! the principal that calls it — rather than the one recorded request.
