//! A comment's reaction state from the write that records it to every read path
//! that carries it: `PutCommentReaction`, `GetComment`, `GetCommentReactions` and
//! `GetCommentsForComparedCommit`, driven as awsJson1_1 requests through the
//! router that serves the real emulator.
//!
//! The rule under test: a reaction value names a reaction of the service's
//! catalog in ANY of the forms the API publishes for it — the reaction's name,
//! its emoji short code (and the further short codes that spell the same
//! reaction), its graphic and its Unicode codepoint — and the reaction a comment
//! then holds is reported from stored state on every path that carries one: as a
//! reaction VALUE, which is the reaction's name, in `callerReactions` and in the
//! keys of `reactionCounts`, a map a comment always carries and which is empty
//! where nobody has reacted, and as the three spellings of
//! `ReactionValueFormats` in the reactions of the comment.
//!
//! The tables below span the class that rule covers — every reaction in the
//! catalog in every form a request may name it by, comments holding no reaction,
//! comments posted at a file, at a line and as a reply, several principals
//! sharing a reaction, a principal holding none, and a reaction removed again —
//! rather than one recorded request.
