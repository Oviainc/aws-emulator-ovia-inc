//! Comments on the comparison between two commits, over the wire:
//! `PostCommentForComparedCommit`, `GetComment`, `UpdateComment`,
//! `DeleteCommentContent` and `PutCommentReaction`, driven as awsJson1_1 requests
//! through the router that serves the real emulator.
//!
//! The rule under test: posting a comment persists it against the comparison it
//! names, and every later answer about that comment — the post's own, a read, an
//! edit, a deletion, a reaction — is computed from that stored record. So a
//! comment keeps its id, its author and its creation date; its content and
//! reactions are whatever the last accepted write left; a reporting call changes
//! nothing; and a request that names a repository, commit, path, position,
//! comment or reaction the service does not hold is refused with the error the
//! model declares for it. The tables below span the class the rule covers —
//! content kinds and the documented size bound, locations on either side of the
//! comparison, every form of every reaction in the service's table, two callers —
//! rather than one recorded request.
