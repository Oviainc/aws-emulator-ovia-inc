//! Deleting the content of a comment: `DeleteCommentContent` end to end, over the
//! wire, against the comments the sibling harness posts on a comparison between
//! two commits.
//!
//! The rule under test: `DeleteCommentContent` clears the CONTENT of the comment
//! its id names and leaves the record itself in place — so the answer, and every
//! later read of that comment, reports it with `deleted` true, no `content`, and
//! the id, author, creation date and reactions it already had; a second call
//! against the same comment, and any attempt to read, edit or react to it, is
//! refused with `CommentDeletedException` and the service's fixed sentence for the
//! action it refused, which carries no value from the request. Other comments are
//! untouched.
//!
//! The table below spans the class that rule covers — content kind and size
//! (ASCII, unicode, multi-line, one character, the documented 10,240-character
//! maximum), whether the comment sits at a line of a file, at a file, or nowhere,
//! whether the comparison has a before side, and whether another principal had
//! reacted to the comment — rather than the one recorded request.
