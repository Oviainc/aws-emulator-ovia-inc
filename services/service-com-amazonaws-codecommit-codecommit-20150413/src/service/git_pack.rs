//! Packfiles: the format git sends objects in, read and written.
//!
//! A `git push` arrives as a packfile in the `git-receive-pack` request body, and
//! a `git clone` or `git fetch` is answered with one in the `git-upload-pack`
//! response. This module is the only place that format is parsed or produced:
//! [`read_pack`] turns a packfile into the objects this emulator stores, and
//! [`write_pack`] turns stored objects back into a packfile.
//!
//! Everything is bounded, and bounded on the PRODUCT rather than per item. A
//! pack larger than [`MAX_PACK_BYTES`], holding more than [`MAX_PACK_OBJECTS`]
//! entries, carrying an object larger than [`MAX_OBJECT_BYTES`], inflating in
//! total to more than [`MAX_PACK_INFLATED_BYTES`], or taking longer than
//! [`MAX_PACK_SECONDS`] is refused rather than read to the end — and no buffer is
//! ever sized from a length the CLIENT declared, only from the bytes actually
//! produced. So a small request cannot drive the emulator's memory or CPU (a "zip
//! bomb" in pack form, whose pack shape is a few bytes of entry header per
//! megabyte of claimed output).
