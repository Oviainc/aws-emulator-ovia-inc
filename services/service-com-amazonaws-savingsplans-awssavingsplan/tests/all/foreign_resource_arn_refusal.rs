//! The ONE rule every `resourceArn`-taking operation shares past the model's
//! `@pattern`: an ARN that is well formed but does not name a resource of THIS
//! service is a 400 `ValidationException` whose message names the ARN the
//! caller sent, identically on every one of those operations.
//!
//! The pattern `SavingsPlanArn` declares pins the partition, the region, the
//! account and the `savingsplan/<uuid>` resource, but leaves the service field
//! as `[a-z]+` (letters only — a namespace carrying a digit never reaches a
//! handler) — so the one thing left for a handler to refuse is an ARN whose
//! service namespace is another all-letter one. `ListTagsForResource`,
//! `TagResource` and `UntagResource` each used to carry their own copy of that
//! refusal; the rows below drive the shared path through all three and assert
//! they answer with the same status, the same code and the same message.
//!
//! Everything goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the emulator boots,
//! reusing the harness in [`crate::savings_plans_lifecycle`].
