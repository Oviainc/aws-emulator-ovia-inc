//! The two error paths every `resourceArn`-taking operation shares: how a
//! refused member is NAMED, and how an unknown resource is REPORTED.
//!
//! Both messages are built from the request, so both are part of the contract:
//!
//! * A constraint violation is stated in the AWS envelope
//!   (`N validation error(s) detected: …`) with the member path rooted at the
//!   REQUEST OBJECT — `originalRequest.<member>` — whatever the constraint
//!   class, whatever the operation and however deep the member sits. The
//!   `@pattern` requirement is quoted as the model writes it, anchors and all.
//! * A well-formed `resourceArn` that names no plan of ours is a 404
//!   `ResourceNotFoundException` whose message names the ARN the caller sent:
//!   `Resource with resourceArn: <arn> doesn't exist`.
//!
//! The ARN pattern admits every AWS partition (`aws([-a-z]*)?`), so an
//! `aws-cn` / `aws-us-gov` / `aws-iso-*` plan ARN is a well-formed ARN that the
//! store simply does not hold — a 404, not a boundary 400.
//!
//! Everything goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the emulator boots,
//! reusing the harness in [`crate::savings_plans_lifecycle`].
