//! The `com-amazonaws-ivs-amazoninteractivevideoservice` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — EDITED HERE. The key and the handler stay the generated
//!   table's; each operation is served through [`StatedEnvelope`], which states a
//!   constraint refusal the way IVS states it and names the request every response
//!   answers. See "How this service words a refusal" and "The envelope every response
//!   carries".
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! # The envelope every response carries
//!
//! AWS answers every IVS call — success or failure — with a request id, and answers a
//! failure with the error's code and text in the places a client reads them. The model
//! says which places: `cors.additionalExposedHeaders`
//! (`smithy_query(query="service_info")`) lists `x-amzn-requestid`, `x-amzn-errortype`
//! and `x-amzn-errormessage`, which are the response headers this service publishes to a
//! browser client and therefore the ones it sends. The protocol serializer already writes
//! `x-amzn-errortype` and the body's `__type` from the modelled error shape, and the body
//! carries the text under the `message` key an SDK error parser reads
//! (`crate::scaffolded`); what is added here is the error DOCUMENT a client of this
//! service reads a failure out of — `Code`, `Message` and `RequestID`, the three members
//! the recorded IVS failures carry — plus the request id on every response and the text
//! beside the code in the header.
//!
//! The id is a property of the RESPONSE, not of any modelled shape: no operation's output
//! declares it, so no handler can carry it, and a failure must carry one exactly as a
//! success does. Hence [`with_response_envelope`], applied at the one place every
//! response an operation of this service answers passes through — [`StatedEnvelope`],
//! the per-operation wrapper.
//!
//! # How this service words a refusal
//!
//! IVS states a value outside a modelled constraint as `<Operation>.<member path>`
//! followed by the constraint it violated — "`CreateChannel.name does not match the
//! required pattern ^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]*$`",
//! "`CreateAdConfiguration.mediaTailorPlaybackConfigurations is required to have a
//! minimum length of 1, found 0`" — where the framework's own pre-dispatch envelope
//! words every service's refusal alike ("1 validation error detected: Value '…' at
//! '…' failed to satisfy constraint: …"), with no operation in it.
//!
//! The operation is not reachable at the framework's refusal seam:
//! [`Service::override_refusal`] is handed the violations alone, with no request and no
//! operation. So the operations are served through [`StatedEnvelope`], which collects the
//! refusal itself — from the framework's own deserializer and constraint walk, so not
//! one modelled constraint is restated here — and words each violation from the
//! OPERATION it refused, which a per-operation wrapper has in scope as `O::NAME`. The
//! sentences live in `crate::state`, beside the message rules the handlers state their
//! modelled failures with, and the body is the one key an SDK error parser reads
//! (`crate::scaffolded::StatedBody`). Nothing else about the request changes: a request
//! this service does not refuse is handed to the generated `ErasedOperation::run`, which
//! owns deserialize -> validate -> handle -> serialize, telemetry, and every modelled
//! error.
//!
//! Two costs of serving the operations this way are deliberate. The wrapper reads the
//! request a second time (`deserialize_input` + `constraints::validate`, which the
//! generated `run` then repeats), so a request the model accepts is parsed and validated
//! twice; the framework exposes no seam that hands a refusal to the service before
//! rendering it, and the correct refusal is worth one extra parse of a control-plane
//! request. And the wrapped set is spelled out in [`wrap_operations`]: an operation the
//! model gains later is NOT wrapped until it is listed there, and keeps the framework's
//! generic sentence until it is — the fallback is a worse message, never a wrong route,
//! because `override_operation` answers `None` for a key it does not hold and the
//! generated table serves it unchanged.
//!
//! A sixth seam, `override_protocol`, is one this service DOES take: the codec every
//! modelled response is rendered through. It is the model's own `restJson1` in every
//! respect but one — every channel object this service serves carries the
//! failover-slate configuration ARN the wire response carries and this model revision
//! declares on neither channel shape. See [`channel_projection`] for that rule; it is
//! applied here, at the one place every response of this service passes through, rather
//! than per operation, because no handler can reach the rendering of its own output and
//! no generated shape can carry a member its model does not declare.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
