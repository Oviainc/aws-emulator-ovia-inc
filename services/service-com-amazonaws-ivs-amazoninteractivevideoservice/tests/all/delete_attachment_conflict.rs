//! What IVS SAYS when a delete is refused because a channel still references the
//! resource the request named — driven over the wire, for every operation that
//! answers that refusal.
//!
//! Every case goes through the real front door (`MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` with a
//! restJson1 request), using the dispatch harness [`crate::channel_lifecycle`] owns.
//!
//! The rule under test, stated once: a delete refused because a channel still points
//! at the resource is the modelled `ConflictException` (409) stating one attachment
//! sentence — `Unable to perform ivs:<OperationName> while ` then the resource (the
//! ARN the request sent, with the resource kind before it for the operations whose
//! sentence spells one) then ` is still attached to a channel`. The ARN is the
//! sentence's only variable part: the channel that holds the reference is not in it,
//! and neither is how many channels hold one.
