//! The envelope every IVS response carries, driven end-to-end over the router the
//! production entrypoint serves.
//!
//! Three rules:
//!
//! 1. A refused call answers a JSON error document stating the error's code under `Code`,
//!    its text under `Message` and the id of the request it answers under `RequestID`,
//!    with the same code in `x-amzn-errortype`, the same text in `x-amzn-errormessage` and
//!    under the `message` key an SDK error parser reads, and the same id in
//!    `x-amzn-requestid` — whatever the error CLASS and whichever channel the failure
//!    travels (a constraint refused at the request boundary, a modelled failure a handler
//!    states, a code the operation's model does not declare, or the scaffold's 501).
//! 2. Every response — a success included — names the request it answers, and no two
//!    responses name the same one.
//! 3. A refusal's dotted member path names each step the way the model names the value at
//!    it, and names an element of a list by its ZERO-based position: the element's own
//!    shape where the model gives the element a shape, the list member's own name where it
//!    does not, and never the synthetic `member` the Smithy list shape names its member by.
//!
//! Each table's rows differ along what its rule generalises over (the operation, the error
//! class, the member, the position in the list, the kind of list), never by renaming one
//! case.
