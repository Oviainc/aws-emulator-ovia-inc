//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-dsql-dsql service.
//!
//! The service's primary resource is the Aurora DSQL cluster, so the store is a
//! map of clusters keyed by their 26-character identifier, plus the two
//! bookkeeping maps the cluster lifecycle needs: the retired (deleted) clusters
//! whose identifiers must never be minted again, and the
//! `clientToken` ledgers that make every `@idempotencyToken`-carrying operation
//! idempotent — each record keyed by the token together with the region of the
//! endpoint that served the call, because a token names a request
//! made at ONE regional endpoint.
//!
//! A change data capture (CDC) stream belongs to exactly one cluster — every
//! stream operation is reached at `/stream/{clusterIdentifier}/...` and a
//! `StreamArn` nests the stream under its cluster's ARN — so a cluster's streams
//! are stored ON the cluster record rather than in a second map beside it: the
//! cluster's deletion takes its streams with it, and no handler can read one of
//! two copies.
//!
//! Besides the data, this module owns the few derivations every cluster handler
//! shares — the request's region, the cluster ARN, the connection endpoint, the
//! encryption details and the modelled "no such resource" errors — so the
//! handlers compute them one way rather than once each. The paginated readers'
//! page walk ([`PageBounds`]) lives here for the same reason: the cursor, the
//! `maxResults` bounds and the rule for when a `nextToken` is issued are one
//! implementation, parameterised by each operation's modelled default and the
//! summary it builds. The answer a served delete keeps for its retry
//! ([`RecordedDelete`]) lives here for the same reason: both deletes record and
//! read back the same members, so the encoding and the refusal of an incomplete
//! record are one implementation, parameterised by the output each handler
//! builds. The answer a served policy write keeps
//! ([`RecordedPolicyWrite`]) lives here on the same terms — both policy writers
//! record and read back the same version member — and so does the answer a
//! call whose only un-derivable member is the status it reported keeps
//! ([`RecordedStatus`]), on the same terms again, and the answer a served
//! `CreateCluster` keeps
//! ([`RecordedClusterCreation`]), as does the
//! refusal every replay path gives for a record that does not hold a member the
//! original call answered ([`recorded_result_unavailable`]), so no two of them
//! can decide that case differently.
//!
//! The checks a request's own input has to pass before anything is written live
//! here for the same reason: a cluster's resource-based policy is attached by two
//! different operations and ends up in ONE record, so the document checks
//! ([`validate_cluster_policy`]) — it has to parse, and unless the caller bypasses
//! the safety check it may not leave nobody able to replace it — are one
//! implementation both of them call, as the witness-Region, peer-list and tag-key
//! checks already are. The identities such a document GRANTS TO are resolved
//! against this account's IAM on the same terms
//! ([`unresolved_policy_principal`], over the principals
//! [`policy_principals`] reads out of it), because a document one entry point would
//! refuse as granting to nobody cannot be reachable through the other. The check that a cluster or stream identifier is an
//! identifier of this service at all ([`is_resource_identifier`], refused by
//! [`validate_cluster_identifier`] / [`validate_stream_identifier`]) lives here on
//! the same terms: eleven routes carry such an identifier, and all of them have to
//! refuse one value the same way. The narrower check the three operations that
//! state the minted value range as a precondition add
//! ([`validate_minted_cluster_identifier`]) is built from that same predicate, so
//! the two cannot disagree about the alphabet.
//!
//! The tagging operations address a resource by a caller-supplied `resourceArn`
//! rather than by identifier, so the read of that ARN ([`parse_resource_arn`]), the
//! check that the ARN is the one this endpoint serves and the one its resource was
//! minted with ([`ArnResource::is_scoped_to`] / [`ArnResource::is_arn_of`]), the tags
//! it resolves to ([`ComAmazonawsDsqlDsqlState::resource_tags_mut`]) and the refusal
//! of a value that names no resource of this service ([`invalid_resource_arn`]) live
//! here too, for the same reason.
