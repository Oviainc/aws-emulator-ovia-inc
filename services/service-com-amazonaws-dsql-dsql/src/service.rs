//! The `com-amazonaws-dsql-dsql` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly, or serve a modelled operation WRAPPED. This service wraps every
//!   one of them in [`InModelledEnvelope`], so a request refused before its
//!   handler runs is refused in this service's own modelled `ValidationException`
//!   rather than in the framework's pre-dispatch envelope (see the section below),
//!   and `CreateStream` additionally behind
//!   [`crate::ops::create_stream::PassRoleGate`], because the pass-role
//!   authorization decision on its `targetDefinition` has to be reached before
//!   the framework's model-constraint validation, and this is the only seam
//!   handed the request.
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! # How this service refuses a request it never ran
//!
//! `ValidationException` is one of the errors this model binds to EVERY operation,
//! and it declares `message` AND `reason` as `@required`
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="ValidationException")`), so a request refused
//! for a modelled constraint is answered with that whole body — `reason`, and
//! `fieldList` naming the members that failed — exactly as this service's handler-side
//! refusals are. The framework's pre-dispatch renderer cannot: its only seam,
//! `override_refusal`, carries a code and a sentence, so the body it writes is
//! `message` alone and a `@required` member is missing from it.
//!
//! Every operation is therefore served through [`InModelledEnvelope`], which states
//! that refusal itself — from the framework's own deserializer and constraint walk —
//! before the handler runs. [`validation`] owns the wording and the modelled body, and
//! `override_refusal` words any refusal the framework still renders from the same
//! helpers so the two paths cannot disagree.
