//! How this service states a request it refused before any handler ran: a member
//! outside a modelled constraint, a `@required` member absent, or a value no
//! modelled type can be read from.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Every such refusal is HTTP 400 with the service's OWN modelled
//! `ValidationException` — the error the model binds to every operation
//! (`smithy_query(query="digest")` reports `common_errors: [AccessDeniedException,
//! InternalServerException, ThrottlingException, ValidationException]`) — so the body
//! carries that shape's members: the `@required` `message`, the `@required` `reason`
//! drawn from `ValidationExceptionReason`, and `fieldList` naming each member that
//! failed (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="ValidationException")`). A `@required`
//! member of a modelled error shape is never absent from a response, so a client that
//! branches on `reason` always has one to read — the same body the handler-side
//! refusals of this service already build through [`crate::state::invalid_member_value`].
//!
//! The framework's own pre-dispatch renderer gets the status (400) and the wire code
//! (`ValidationException`) right and the BODY wrong: its only seam,
//! `Service::override_refusal`, can choose a code and a sentence and nothing else, so
//! the rendered body is `message` alone. [`modeled_refusal`] therefore states the
//! refusal itself, from the framework's own deserializer and constraint walk, and
//! serializes it through the model's `ValidationException` schema. `super`'s
//! `InModelledEnvelope` is what puts it in front of every operation.
//!
//! # The one refusal that is NOT a `ValidationException`
//!
//! A tag map carrying more entries than `TagMap` admits is a bad request BODY rather
//! than a member-level constraint failure, and Aurora DSQL answers it
//! [`BAD_REQUEST_CODE`] with [`BAD_REQUEST_MESSAGE`] — an error its REST frontend
//! answers before any operation's own errors are reachable, so there is no modelled
//! shape to serialize. [`refusal_for`] declines it and the framework's refusal path,
//! worded by `super`'s `override_refusal` from these same helpers, answers it.
