//! Deleting an Aurora DSQL change data capture (CDC) stream, end to end over the
//! wire.
//!
//! RULE: `DeleteStream` deletes the ONE stream its two `@httpLabel`s name — the
//! stream reports `DELETING`, the clock then removes it from its cluster, so
//! `GetStream` answers 404 `ResourceNotFoundException` and `ListStreams` stops
//! listing it while every other stream of that cluster is untouched — and every
//! member of the answer is read off the stored record. A status that does not
//! accept a mutation, on the stream or on the cluster the stream is stored on,
//! refuses the deletion with 409 `ConflictException`; the delete of a stream that
//! is already deleting answers with the delete in flight. `@idempotent`: a retry
//! carrying the same `client-token` answers the result of the original call, even
//! once the stream is gone, and that token carried by a DIFFERENT delete is a 409
//! `ConflictException`.
//!
//! Every case drives the real request path through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`
//! with a signed-looking restJson1 request, so the
//! `/stream/{clusterIdentifier}/{streamIdentifier}` route, the `@httpLabel` and
//! `@httpQuery` bindings and the handler are exercised the way a client exercises
//! them. The wire harness (`Dsql`, `Answer`, the clock wait) is the one in
//! `tests/all/harness.rs` that every suite in this crate shares.
//!
//! The tables assert the rule over a CLASS of inputs rather than one request: the
//! deletion of a stream picked out of several, in several regions; the idempotency
//! of a repeated `client-token` over several token forms; and the status gate
//! across the WHOLE published `StreamStatus` and `ClusterStatus` catalogs, reached
//! by seeding the store because no caller can drive a resource into most of them.
