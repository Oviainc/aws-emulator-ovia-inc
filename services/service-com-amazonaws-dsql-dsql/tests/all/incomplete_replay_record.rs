//! What a recognised `clientToken` retry answers when the record it has to be
//! served from does not hold a member the original call answered.
//!
//! RULE under test: a handler serving a retry its idempotency ledger recognises
//! answers every member the original call RECORDED from that record, and refuses
//! the retry with 500 `InternalServerException` when the record holds no value
//! for one — never an answer carrying a value re-derived from the live resource,
//! and never by acting on the request a second time.
//!
//! The table spans the class rather than one operation: every replay path of this
//! service that serves a recorded member and is not already pinned by
//! `tests/all/shared_recorded_delete.rs` (which covers the two deletes) —
//! `CreateCluster`, `UpdateCluster`, `CreateStream`, `PutClusterPolicy` and
//! `DeleteClusterPolicy` — crossed with the two records a ledger can hold against
//! the resource the first call acted on: the complete one a served call keeps,
//! which is served, and one holding no answered member at all, which is refused.
//! The recorded value every row seeds differs from the live resource's, so an
//! answer re-derived from the store is distinguishable from the recorded one.
//!
//! Every case drives the real request path through the `Dsql` harness in
//! `tests/all/harness.rs`, this crate's one test client.
