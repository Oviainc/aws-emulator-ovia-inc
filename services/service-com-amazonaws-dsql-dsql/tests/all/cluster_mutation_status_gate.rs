//! The one status gate every mutation of a cluster record passes through.
//!
//! RULE: a request that WRITES a stored cluster's record is refused with 409
//! `ConflictException` unless the cluster's status accepts a mutation — only a
//! settled cluster does, not one the clock still owes a transition and not one
//! already on its way out — and a refused request leaves the record exactly as it
//! was. The one exemption is the delete of a cluster whose deletion is already
//! under way — either leg of that chain, the peering tear-down
//! (`PENDING_DELETE`) or the removal (`DELETING`) — which answers with the delete
//! already in flight.
//!
//! The first table is the whole class: every `ClusterStatus` the model declares
//! crossed with every operation that writes a cluster record, each case on its own
//! cluster, driven over the wire through the `Dsql` harness in
//! `tests/all/harness.rs` — this crate's one test client. Statuses no caller can
//! drive a cluster into over the wire are reached by seeding the store, which is
//! what makes the table span the catalog rather than the three statuses
//! `CreateCluster`, `UpdateCluster` and `DeleteCluster` happen to produce.
//!
//! The second case is the same rule driven entirely over the wire, through the
//! clock's own `CREATING -> ACTIVE` and `UPDATING -> ACTIVE` windows.
