//!
//! The operation is a pure function of the submitted document, so every suite here
//! asserts the RULE over a table of documents rather than one recorded request: each
//! entity the recogniser reports carries a modelled `EntityType`, a confidence in
//! `(0, 1]`, and zero-based CHARACTER offsets whose slice of the document is exactly
//! the entity's own `Text`; the entities come back in document order and never
//! overlap; and the evidence that types a span is the document's own — a closed-form
//! lexical pattern, a lexicon entry, or a cue beside the span.
