//! How Comprehend admits the `LanguageCode` of a request whose operation accepts
//! fewer languages than the shared `LanguageCode` enum declares.
//!
//! THE RULE, asserted over a SET of operations and over every value the model's
//! `LanguageCode` enum names rather than over one recorded call: where an operation's
//! own accepted set is narrower than the enumerated type its member targets, a value
//! outside that set is refused at the REQUEST-VALIDATION boundary — HTTP 400,
//! `ValidationException`, in the validator's own enum-constraint clause naming the
//! member path, the value the request carried and that operation's accepted set — and
//! a value inside the set is not refused for its language at all. The modelled
//! `UnsupportedLanguageException` is a different condition: a language the service
//! cannot PROCESS, which the operations whose analyser is language-bound
//! (`DetectSentiment`, `DetectSyntax`, `DetectEntities`, `DetectToxicContent` and the
//! `BatchDetect*` family) keep answering with and `sync_inference`, `syntax`,
//! `entity_detection` and `toxic_content` assert.
//!
//! The clause is the validator's own down to its punctuation: no
//! `<N> validation error(s) detected: ` envelope, and no space between the quoted
//! value and `failed`.
