//! What `BatchDetectDominantLanguage`, `BatchDetectSentiment` and `BatchDetectSyntax`
//! report for a document, as a CONVENTION rather than as one recorded answer.
//!
//! Each suite drives the batched operation — one `ResultList` entry per document, so
//! every row of a table rides in a batch — and asserts the rule that operation's own
//! analyser follows:
//!
//! 1. `BatchDetectDominantLanguage`: `Languages` carries the candidates the
//!    identification engine DETECTED, ranked, each with a confidence strictly inside
//!    `(0, 1)` that follows the engine's own margin — a document plainly in one
//!    language is answered with that language alone, one the engine cannot place is
//!    answered with the candidates it ranked, and neither is answered with a
//!    certainty.
//! 2. `BatchDetectSentiment`: the four confidences are a distribution over the four
//!    modelled classes — they sum to 1, none of them is a flat zero, `MIXED` is the
//!    one reported for a document carrying both polarities, and the confidence follows
//!    how much sentiment-bearing material the document holds.
//! 3. `BatchDetectSyntax`: a tag is the reading the token's own evidence and the
//!    context it stands in support, so the same word in two contexts can come back
//!    with two tags and two confidences, and the confidence is near certainty only
//!    where the evidence is.
//!
//! The fourth analyser of the family, `BatchDetectKeyPhrases`, is held in
//! `noun_phrase_key_phrases.rs`, which reads this suite's batch helpers.
//!
//! Every table spans what its rule generalises over — language, document length,
//! clarity, the word classes present, the construction a word stands in, the polarity
//! balance and the amount of evidence — rather than the one recorded request.
