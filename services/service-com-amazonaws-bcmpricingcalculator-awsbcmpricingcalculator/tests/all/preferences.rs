//! The rate-type preferences plane (`UpdatePreferences` / `GetPreferences`), driven
//! end-to-end over this service's awsJson1_0 wire through the same router the
//! production front door uses.
//!
//! The RULE every suite here asserts: `GetPreferences` reports exactly the rate-type
//! record `UpdatePreferences` last stored, member by member — a supplied selection
//! replaces the stored one, an omitted one keeps its stored value, and all three
//! selections are reported whether or not anybody ever wrote them (an account that never
//! wrote one has the effective selection `state::DEFAULT_RATE_TYPE_SELECTION`). The rows
//! of each table differ along what the rule generalises over: which members a request
//! carries, which `RateType` values, how many of them, and in which order.
//!
//! Writing the record is gated on the caller's account class; these suites therefore
//! drive an emulator that may write (`Emulator::new`). The gate is pinned in
//! `account_class_gate`.
