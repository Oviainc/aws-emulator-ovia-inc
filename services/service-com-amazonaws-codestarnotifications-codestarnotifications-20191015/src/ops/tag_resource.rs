//! @op TagResource
//!
//! Associates tags with a notification rule: the supplied `Tags` are MERGED into the
//! rule [`crate::state`] holds for the ARN (a key the rule already carries takes the new
//! value), and the resulting map is what the operation answers with — the same map
//! `DescribeNotificationRule` then reports.
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected); `ctx` carries request metadata
//! only — the request's SigV4 scope is the region whose rules this endpoint addresses.
//!

//!
//! # Modeled contract for `TagResource`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-codestarnotifications-codestarnotifications-20191015/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-codestarnotifications-codestarnotifications-20191015.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Associates a set of provided tags with a notification rule.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `Arn` (NotificationRuleArn, pattern
//!   ^arn:aws[^:\s]*:codestar-notifications:[^:\s]+:\d{12}:notificationrule\/(.*\S)?$)
//!   **required** — The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notification rule to tag.
//! * `Tags` (Tags) **required** — The list of tags to associate with the resource. Tag key
//!   names cannot start with "aws".
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `Tags` (Tags) — The list of tags associated with the resource.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `ConcurrentModificationException` (HTTP 400) — CodeStar Notifications can't complete the
//!   request because the resource is being modified by another process. Wait a few minutes
//!   and try again.
//! * `LimitExceededException` (HTTP 400) — One of the CodeStar Notifications limits has been
//!   exceeded. Limits apply to accounts, notification rules, notifications, resources, and
//!   targets. For more information, see Limits.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — CodeStar Notifications can't find a resource
//!   that matches the provided ARN.
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — One or more parameter values are not valid.
//! * `AccessDeniedException` (HTTP 403) — widened in through `extra_errors` (see below):
//!   the answer the resource-based authorization check gives an `Arn` that names no
//!   notification rule of this service.
