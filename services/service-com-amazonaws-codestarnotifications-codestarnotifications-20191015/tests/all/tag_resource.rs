//! `TagResource` over the wire: what tagging a notification rule does, and what it
//! answers for a rule that is not there.
//!
//! The RULE: tagging MERGES the supplied map into the rule the ARN names — a key the rule
//! already carries takes the new value, keys the request does not name are left alone —
//! and answers with the resulting map, which is the same map `DescribeNotificationRule`
//! then reports. An ARN no rule of this account and region holds is refused with 404
//! `ResourceNotFoundException` over the whole submitted ARN, whether the rule never
//! existed or was deleted.
//!
//! Each suite asserts that over a TABLE whose rows differ in what the rule generalises
//! over — how many keys are supplied, whether they are new or already held, the shape of
//! the key and the value — rather than pinning one recorded request.
//!
//! The harness (`Emulator`, `error_code`, `message`, `string`, `tags_of`, …) is the one
//! `notification_rule_lifecycle` already builds: one shared engine behind the same
//! `MultiServiceRouter` dispatch the emulator serves production requests with.
