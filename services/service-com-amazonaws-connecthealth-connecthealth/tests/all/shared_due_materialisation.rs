//! End-to-end HTTP coverage of the ONE preamble every handler of this service runs
//! before it resolves anything.
//!
//! The RULE under test, asserted over a table rather than one operation: a handler
//! materialises EVERYTHING the clock has already made due, never one class of owed work
//! and not another — so after ANY operation of this service has run, a domain whose
//! deletion had fallen due is gone AND a patient insights job whose next status
//! transition had fallen due has been moved on. Because each piece of owed work is
//! applied AT the instant it fell due rather than at the instant somebody looked, running
//! the preamble in one handler changes no value another handler reports, which is what
//! makes one shared preamble indistinguishable on the wire from the per-handler ones it
//! replaces.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which operation is driven (a
//! point reader, a listing, a creator, a deleter, the two status transitions, the three
//! ARN-addressed tagging operations, and both patient-insights handlers), its HTTP
//! method, what it is addressed to, and whether it resolves that (its modelled success)
//! or misses it (the modelled 404) — the preamble runs before the resolution, so a miss
//! materialises the owed work too.
//!
//! Every route and success status written here comes from
//! `smithy_query(query="digest",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-connecthealth-connecthealth/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-connecthealth-connecthealth.json")`,
//! and the `sessionId` of the miss row is a value of the modelled `ScribeSessionId`
//! (`@length 36..36`, pattern
//! `[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}`).
