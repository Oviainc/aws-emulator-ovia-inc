//! @op StartMedicalScribeListeningSession
//!
//! `POST /medical-scribe-stream/ -> 200`. Opens a Medical Scribe listening session on a
//! live (`domainId`, `subscriptionId`) pair: reads the session's parameters off the
//! request headers, applies the events the caller framed into the request body, PERSISTS
//! the session record ([`crate::state::ScribeSession`]), and answers with the session's
//! own response headers and a `MedicalScribeOutputStream` body.
//!
//! This is the one operation that creates a listening session, so what it stores is
//! exactly what [`super::get_medical_scribe_listening_session`] reports back: the
//! language, sample rate and encoding the headers negotiated, the post-stream action
//! settings, channel definitions and encounter-context flag a `configurationEvent`
//! carried, and the stream's status.
//!
//! ## What the input stream's events do
//!
//! `MedicalScribeInputStream` is a union of four members and binds none of them as
//! required (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="MedicalScribeInputStream")`), so the
//! events are applied in ARRIVAL ORDER and a member the stream never sends simply
//! configures nothing:
//!
//! * `configurationEvent` — carries the `postStreamActionSettings` the session is set up
//!   with (required WITHIN that event), its optional `channelDefinitions` and its
//!   optional `encounterContext`. All of it is stored on the session, which is where the
//!   reader gets it from; the context itself is `@sensitive` and only the modelled
//!   `encounterContextProvided` flag is kept.
//! * `audioEvent` / `binaryAudioEvent` — one chunk of audio each. They differ only in
//!   where the chunk travels: `MedicalScribeAudioEvent$audioChunk` is an ordinary blob
//!   member, so it arrives base64-encoded inside the frame's JSON payload, while
//!   `MedicalScribeBinaryAudioEvent$audioChunk` is the event's `@eventPayload`, so the
//!   frame payload IS the raw chunk.
//! * `sessionControlEvent` — `END_OF_SESSION` is the one type the model declares, and it
//!   ends the stream: the session moves to `COMPLETED` and is stamped with its end
//!   instant. A stream that sends none stays `IN_PROGRESS`, because the model lets a
//!   session be resumed under the same `sessionId`.
//!
//! ## What the response stream carries
//!
//! `MedicalScribeOutputStream` carries a transcript event or one of two in-band errors,
//! and this emulator has NO speech recogniser. So no `transcriptEvent` is ever framed
//! and none is invented: a stream that carried audio is answered with the modelled
//! `internalFailureException` member, framed as an in-band exception with
//! [`NO_RECOGNISER`] as its message, and a stream that carried no audio is answered with
//! no event at all — there is nothing to transcribe and nothing failed. The SESSION is
//! real either way, which is the point of the operation: it is stored, it is readable
//! through `GetMedicalScribeListeningSession`, and the response headers are read back
//! out of the stored record.
//!
//! ## Why this operation is hand-authored
//!
//! Its input carries a `@streaming` event-stream member and its output is a `@streaming`
//! union. The op-stub generator declines the first and the generated `ErasedOperation`
//! shim declines the second, because `serialize_as_event_stream<P>` needs a `Sized`
//! protocol that an object-safe `run` cannot hand it. The framing, the request reader,
//! the response and the routing seam are the shared ones in
//! `service_common::event_stream`; `src/service.rs` routes a request here through
//! `Service::override_operation`, which the router consults BEFORE the generated routing
//! table. Two readers a streaming input needs are local to this file for the reason that
//! module's own documentation gives: the header-bound half of the request, and one
//! frame's payload.
//!
//! ## Input (every member an `@httpHeader` except the payload)
//!
//! * `sessionId` (ScribeSessionId, len 36..36, UUID pattern) **required**
//! * `domainId` (DomainId, len 20..25, pattern `^(hai-|dom-)[a-z0-9]+$`) **required**
//! * `subscriptionId` (SubscriptionId, len 25..25, pattern `^sub-[a-zA-Z0-9]{21}$`)
//!   **required**
//! * `languageCode` (MedicalScribeLanguageCode: en-US | multi) **required**
//! * `mediaSampleRateHertz` (integer, range 8000..48000) **required**
//! * `mediaEncoding` (MedicalScribeMediaEncoding: pcm | flac) **required**
//! * `inputStream` (MedicalScribeInputStream, `@httpPayload`, `@streaming`)
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! `sessionId`, `domainId`, `subscriptionId`, `requestId`, `languageCode`,
//! `mediaSampleRateHertz` and `mediaEncoding` as response headers, and `responseStream`
//! (`MedicalScribeOutputStream`, `@httpPayload`, `@streaming`) as the body.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `AccessDeniedException` (HTTP 401) — the client supplied no proper credentials.
//! * `InternalServerException` (HTTP 500) — a transient failure of the service itself.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — the domain or the subscription the headers
//!   name is not held in the Region the request was signed for.
//! * `ServiceQuotaExceededException` (HTTP 402) — the request exceeds a service quota.
//! * `ThrottlingException` (HTTP 429) — the client exceeded the allowed request rate.
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — the request breaks the model's rules.
