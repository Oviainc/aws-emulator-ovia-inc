//! Type definitions reached only by the `start_medical_scribe_listening_session`
//! operation: the header-bound halves of its input and output, and the event
//! structures its `@streaming` input union carries.
//!
//! Each structure/union is declared exactly once across this service's `types/`
//! modules, and `types/mod.rs` re-exports them all — the shapes the implemented
//! `GetMedicalScribeListeningSession` already declares
//! (`MedicalScribeChannelDefinition`, the `*Response` projections of the post-stream
//! settings, every exception) are reused from `get_medical_scribe_listening_session_types`
//! and `shared_types` rather than re-declared here.
//!
//! ## Why the `Settings` / `Headers` pair exists
//!
//! `StartMedicalScribeListeningSession` binds every input member but one to an
//! `@httpHeader`; the remaining member is the `@streaming` event-stream
//! `@httpPayload`, whose framing the generated codec does not speak. Declaring the
//! request shape with that one member in `unsupported = [..]` gives a struct the
//! framework's own HTTP-binding deserializer fills from the request headers and
//! `constraints::validate` checks against the model's `@range` / `@pattern` /
//! `@length` / enum-membership traits — so the header half of the request is
//! validated by the MODEL, not by hand — while the payload half is decoded from real
//! `vnd.amazon.eventstream` frames in the operation itself. The response is the same
//! split: the `Headers` struct serializes the modelled response headers and the event
//! stream is the body.
//!
//! No OUTPUT-stream event structure is declared here. That is deliberate: this
//! emulator runs no speech recogniser, so no `MedicalScribeTranscriptEvent` is ever
//! constructed (see the operation's own module documentation); the one in-band member
//! it does frame, `InternalServerException`, is already declared in `shared_types`.
