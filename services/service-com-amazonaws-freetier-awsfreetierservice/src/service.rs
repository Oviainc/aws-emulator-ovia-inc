//! The `com-amazonaws-freetier-awsfreetierservice` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. Return `Some(op)` to route one yourself; this
//!   service returns the shared wrapper that serves the routing table's own
//!   operation and re-announces its answer's media type (see "The media type this
//!   service announces" below).
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …); this service keeps that rendering word for word and re-announces its
//!   media type.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering; this service keeps that rendering and re-announces its media type.
//! - `override_protocol` — the codec this service's own responses are serialized
//!   in. The default returns `None`, keeping the model-derived protocol; this
//!   service overrides it (see "The media type this service announces" below).
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## The media type this service announces
//!
//! The model declares the `awsJson1_0` protocol trait, but every recorded response
//! of this service — HTTP 200 and HTTP 400 alike — announces
//! `application/x-amz-json-1.1`, and the media type a client reads is what it keys
//! content negotiation and protocol assertion off. The rule, the one function that
//! applies it and the operation-seam wrapper that reaches the refusal tail all live
//! in [`service_common::response_media_type`];
//! [`RESPONSE_MEDIA_TYPE`](announced_media_type::RESPONSE_MEDIA_TYPE) is this
//! service's pair, and the three seams it is applied at are:
//!
//! - `override_protocol` serves the awsJson `1.1` codec, which is what the
//!   centralized walk serializes this service's own responses with — every success
//!   and every error a handler raises. The JSON framing is byte-identical to `1.0`,
//!   so a request sent with either media type still reads, and only the announced
//!   media type changes;
//! - `override_operation` hands back the shared
//!   [`ResponseMediaTypeOperation`](service_common::response_media_type::ResponseMediaTypeOperation),
//!   which serves the modelled operation the generated routing table names and
//!   re-announces what that walk answered — reaching the framework's refusal tail
//!   INSIDE the walk (an absent `@required` member, a value outside a declared
//!   bound), which `override_protocol` deliberately does not reach;
//! - `override_routing_error` and `override_framework_error` re-announce the other
//!   two framework-rendered responses, keeping their status, code and body word for
//!   word.
//!
//! One response is still announced by the framework alone, because no author seam
//! reaches it: the authentication refusal, which the router renders through
//! `definition().refusal_response(..)` before this service is asked anything
//! (`vendor/smithy-server-runtime/src/multi_service_router.rs`).
//!
//! ## This service's other edited seam: how a broken constraint is stated
//!
//! The framework refuses a request that breaks a constraint the model declares BEFORE
//! any handler runs, and lets the service choose the words. Two parts of the sentence
//! AWS states cannot be produced from the violations alone, which is all
//! `override_refusal` is handed:
//!
//! * the value a clause echoes. The constraint walk stores it ELIDED (a bounded prefix
//!   plus a byte-count marker AWS never emits), because a clause interpolates whatever
//!   is stored and a caller controls the length; the submitted bytes are only
//!   recoverable from the built input.
//! * the value a clause states at a LIST member when one of its ELEMENTS failed. AWS
//!   reports such a failure at the list and echoes the whole list; the violation carries
//!   the one element.
//!
//! [`StatedPerOperation`] is where both come from: every modelled operation is served
//! wrapped in it, the wrapper asks `service_common::validation` for the framework's OWN
//! violations against that operation's input schema — echoes restored — together with
//! the request's own lists, and [`validation`] turns them into the sentence. It
//! re-announces the media type too, so the wrapper that existed for the refusal tail
//! alone ([`ResponseMediaTypeOperation`]) is the fallback for a routable request no
//! wrapper covers rather than the first choice. `override_refusal` states a refusal that
//! reaches the centralized walk anyway through the SAME module, so the wording lives in
//! ONE place — it just has only the violations to state from.
//!
//! The refusals a HANDLER words — a filter whose root-operator arity is wrong, an
//! activity id the catalog does not hold, a `nextToken` this service did not issue — are
//! not here: they are the operations' own, stated in the envelope
//! [`crate::state::stated_validation`] writes so this service's own validation layer
//! words every one of them the same way.
