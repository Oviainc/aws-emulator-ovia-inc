//! How this service states a request the boundary validator refused, in the modelled
//! `ValidationException`.
//!
//! The framework walks every modelled input constraint and hands the result over
//! STRUCTURALLY — one [`Violation`] per offending value, carrying the path it sits at,
//! what it failed and what it held — and leaves the wording to the service, because no
//! model records it. This module is that wording for every modelled input constraint of
//! this service: ONE formatter, reached by every refusal this service answers, so no
//! operation can word a refusal its own way.
//!
//! The rules it implements, as AWS states a constraint violation:
//!
//! * a clause names the offending MEMBER PATH and the CONSTRAINT that member violated,
//!   and NOTHING of the value the caller sent: `Value at '<path>' failed to satisfy
//!   constraint: <requirement>`. An absent member is the one exception, reported as the
//!   `null` it was — a fact of the request's shape rather than a rendering of a value.
//!   Echoing the value back is wrong whatever the member: the clause's job is to say
//!   what the request must satisfy, which the rejected value does not help with, and
//!   anything that surfaces or persists the message would otherwise reproduce caller
//!   input AWS deliberately omits;
//! * a `@pattern` requirement quotes the expression WITHOUT the `^` / `$` anchors a
//!   model spells it with to demand a whole-string match: a caller that lifts the
//!   advertised expression out of the message and re-applies it locally must get the
//!   expression the service advertises;
//! * the clauses are counted and joined into the AWS envelope — `1 validation error
//!   detected: <clause>` for one, `N validation errors detected: <clause>; <clause>`
//!   for several — in the order the walk found them;
//! * the envelope is written into a member the model BOUNDS, so a refusal states as
//!   many WHOLE clauses as that bound leaves room for and the count it states is the
//!   number of clauses it states — a message is never longer than the member it travels
//!   in can carry (see [`MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`] and [`bounded_message`]).
//!
//! The last of those is a rule about the body this service WRITES rather than about the
//! request, so it holds of every value any refusal of this service reports, not only of
//! its prose: an ARN reported back to a client travels in a member the model bounds too,
//! and [`reportable_resource_arn`] is that rule for an identifier, which — unlike a
//! sentence — cannot be cut down to the bound and still name what was asked about.
//!
//! Both halves of a refusal body are built from the same clause: the `message`
//! envelope and each `fieldList` entry's own `message` (see
//! [`field_validation_failed`]), so the two cannot drift.
//!
//! Nothing here is keyed to an operation, a member name or a value: the rule is applied
//! to whatever [`Violation`] the walk produces, so it holds for every constrained member
//! of every operation of this service — `InvoiceReceiver`'s `@pattern`, `Name`'s length
//! and pattern, `MaxResults`' range, the ARN patterns, a member nested in `Rule` or in a
//! `ResourceTag` alike.
//!
//! A violation class this module has no wording for declines the WHOLE refusal, which
//! keeps the framework's own sentence rather than inventing one: [`ViolationKind`] is
//! `#[non_exhaustive]`, so a class can be added upstream.
//!
//! One recorded body cannot be matched here and is deliberately not fitted: the wire
//! recording this rendering was filed against carries a `fieldList` entry whose
//! `message` is SCRUBBED — the part of the clause that named the rejected value was
//! replaced, when the recording was taken, by a literal `[redacted]` placeholder (the
//! same recording's top-level `message`, which this module reproduces exactly, carries
//! no value at all). No rule of the service produces that placeholder, so the entry
//! states the clause the rule gives.
