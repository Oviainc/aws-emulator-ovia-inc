//! `UpdateProcurementPortalPreferenceStatus` driven end to end over this service's wire
//! protocol, every write proved by reading the preference back through
//! `GetProcurementPortalPreference` and `ListProcurementPortalPreferences`.
//!
//! Every call here goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses:
//! `POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an awsJson1_0 body.
//! Nothing reaches into the state struct, so what these tests see is exactly what an SDK
//! client sees.
//!
//! The rules under test, each spanned by a table rather than one request:
//!
//! * a plane whose status the request STATES takes that status, and its status reason
//!   becomes the reason stated alongside it — absent when the request states none;
//! * a plane whose status the request does NOT state keeps the status and reason the last
//!   write left;
//! * the write advances `Version` by one and moves `LastUpdateDate`, leaving the identity
//!   members, `CreateDate` and the configuration alone;
//! * a status outside the modelled enum, a request that states no status at all, and a
//!   status reason stated without its status are each refused, and a refused request
//!   writes nothing;
//! * an ARN naming no stored preference is the modelled not-found;
//! * a `ClientToken` replay applies the update once.
//!
//! Every status a row states is one a CALLER may ask a plane to move to from where that
//! plane stands: the statuses the service assigns itself are refused, which the table in
//! `procurement_portal_preference_status_machine` spans.
