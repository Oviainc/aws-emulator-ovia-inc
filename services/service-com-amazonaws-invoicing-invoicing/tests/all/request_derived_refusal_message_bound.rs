//! The SIZE of a refusal this service words from a request, driven end to end over this
//! service's wire protocol: `POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an
//! awsJson1_0 body through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses, so
//! what these tests read is what an SDK client reads.
//!
//! The rule under test: a message this service words from a request is held to the
//! modelled maximum of the member it travels in — every error shape of this model carries
//! its explanatory text in a `message` member targeting `BasicString`,
//! `@length(min: 0, max: 1024)` (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="BasicString")`), and
//! `@length` on a string counts CHARACTERS — so no request can make a refusal carry a text
//! that member never holds, nor decide how large the refusal is.
//!
//! `message_fits_the_modelled_bound.rs` pins that bound over the number of violations a
//! refusal states and over the LENGTH of the one caller-supplied identifier of this model
//! with no maximum of its own (`ListProcurementPortalSuppliers`' `PortalIdentifier`,
//! which targets `ProcurementPortalIdString`, `@length(min: 1)` and no max). This suite
//! spans what a length alone does not reach:
//!
//! 1. the WIDTH of the characters that identifier is made of — one, two, three and four
//!    bytes each — so the bound is held in characters, the cut lands on a character
//!    boundary, and the refusal's size in BYTES stays the service's to decide however
//!    large the request is;
//! 2. the OTHER messages this service words from a request — the preference-ARN 404, the
//!    403 naming a refused account and the duplicate-`Name` 400 — each at the longest
//!    value its own member admits, where that message is longest.
