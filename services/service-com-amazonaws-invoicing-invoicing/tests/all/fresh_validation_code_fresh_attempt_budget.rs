//! The ATTEMPT BUDGET a refused validation code is reported against, driven end to end
//! over this service's wire protocol through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production
//! router uses, with the shared harness of `refused_procurement_portal_writes`.
//!
//! The rule under test: the attempt count a refused code submission reports counts the
//! submissions refused against the code CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING, so the call that issues a
//! code starts that count again — `SendProcurementPortalValidation` "initiates the
//! validation process by issuing a validation code" (`smithy_query(query="doc",
//! shape="SendProcurementPortalValidation")`) and is the remedy the spent-budget refusal
//! names, so a client that follows that instruction reads attempt 1 of the budget for the
//! fresh code instead of the previous code's spent one, and the number it drives its
//! "retry or ask again" decision off stays inside the budget it is stated against.
//!
//! Its counterpart, which pins the count to the ISSUING rather than to any call that
//! writes: a configuration update issues no code, so it starts no second budget either —
//! the attempts already made against the outstanding code still count.
//!
//! Each test is a table: the rows differ along how many submissions were refused before a
//! fresh code is asked for (none, one, exactly the budget, past it), whether the earlier
//! round completed the validation first, how many fresh codes follow one another, the
//! portals a preference can route to, and the form the submitted wrong code takes.
