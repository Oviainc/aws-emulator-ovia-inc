//! Which accounts `BatchGetInvoiceProfile` may be asked about, driven end to end over
//! this service's wire protocol.
//!
//! The operation is documented "This gets the invoice profile associated with a set of
//! accounts. The accounts must be linked accounts under the requester management account
//! organization" (`smithy_query(query="doc", shape="BatchGetInvoiceProfile")`), so the
//! rule under test is: a profile is reported for exactly those account ids the requester
//! may be answered for — the ones this service's state names as LINKED accounts of its
//! organization, plus the requester's OWN account — and every other account id refuses the
//! request WHOLE with the modelled 403 `AccessDeniedException`.
//!
//! Membership of the organization is read out of state and out of nothing else. The
//! requester's own account is the one account that does not depend on it: a principal has
//! access to the resources of the account it authenticates as, so the requester may read
//! its own account's profile whatever state holds beside it.
//!
//! The table below spans every arrangement this service's state can take around one
//! account id — named nowhere, named as an invoice unit's `InvoiceReceiver`, as an entry
//! of a rule's `LinkedAccounts` (sole or one of several, current or superseded), named
//! only by a unit that was deleted again, and named only as a `BillSourceAccounts` entry
//! — applied BOTH to the requester's own account and to an ordinary account id, and each
//! arrangement is probed with every account the case knows about plus the batch shapes a
//! request takes.
