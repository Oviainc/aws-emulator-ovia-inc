//! The two refusals of the procurement-portal-preference plane this suite pins, driven end
//! to end over this service's wire protocol with the shared harness of
//! `refused_procurement_portal_writes` rather than a copy of it.
//!
//! 1. A create whose PORTAL IDENTIFIERS already identify a stored preference is refused
//!    with the modelled `ConflictException` (HTTP 409), whose message is FIXED text for
//!    that error class: it interpolates nothing from the request or from state, because
//!    the preference it conflicts with travels in the shape's own `resourceId` /
//!    `resourceType` members instead.
//! 2. `SendProcurementPortalValidation` reports the DELIVERY of the test e-invoice that
//!    carries the code it issued, which this emulator makes to no procurement portal: the
//!    call is refused with the modelled `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) naming the
//!    delivery target it could not reach — the endpoint the preference configures for that
//!    document, with the portal's cXML invoice path under it — and the code it issued stays
//!    outstanding, so the flow the refusal points at still completes. The refused delivery
//!    attempt is RECORDED: it advances the preference's `Version` by exactly one and moves
//!    no plane's status.
//!
//! Each rule is spanned by a table: the identifiers a conflicting create can repeat (every
//! portal of the enum and the identifier shapes the pair admits), and the endpoints a
//! preference can configure the delivery target from (paths, a trailing slash, a port, a
//! query, the test environment's own endpoint under the connection-testing method that
//! replays into it, and no endpoint at all).
