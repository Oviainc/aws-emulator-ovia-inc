//! What a REFUSED submission of a procurement-portal validation code leaves behind for
//! the OTHER preferences in the registry, driven end to end over this service's wire
//! protocol.
//!
//! The rule under test is the one `refused_procurement_portal_writes.rs` states and whose
//! harness this suite reuses rather than copying: what a call WRITES is what a reader
//! reports, and a refused submission of a validation code writes the attempt it reports
//! against the preference it was submitted FOR — and nothing else
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="ProcurementPortalPreference")`: `LastUpdateDate`
//! is "the date and time when the procurement portal preference was last updated"). This
//! suite takes it one resource further out: a refused submission against ONE preference
//! leaves every other preference in the registry — at its own version, with a validation
//! code of its own outstanding — exactly where its own last write left it, including when
//! the code submitted is that other preference's own.
//!
//! The rows are the forms a submitted code can be wrong in; the shared helpers (the
//! router, the wire call, the create, the reader, and the code issue the portal flow needs)
//! come from `refused_procurement_portal_writes`, so there is one harness for this plane.
