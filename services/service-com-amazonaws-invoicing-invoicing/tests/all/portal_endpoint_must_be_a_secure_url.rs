//! The URL requirement a write of a procurement portal preference applies to the delivery
//! endpoint it stores, driven end to end over this service's wire protocol: `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an awsJson1_0 body, through the same
//! `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses, so what these tests see is what an SDK
//! client sees.
//!
//! RULE: an input member the model documents as having to be a valid HTTPS URL takes only a
//! URL that names the `https` scheme and a host; any other value is the modelled
//! `ValidationException` (HTTP 400), answered before the write stores anything.
//! `CreateProcurementPortalPreferenceRequest$ProcurementPortalInstanceEndpoint` is "the
//! endpoint URL where e-invoices will be delivered to the procurement portal. Must be a
//! valid HTTPS URL" and the update's own member states the same requirement for the value it
//! writes (`smithy_query(query="shape",
//! shape="CreateProcurementPortalPreferenceRequest,PutProcurementPortalPreferenceRequest")`),
//! while those members' only modelled constraints — `BasicStringWithoutSpace`'s
//! `@length(0..1024)` and `^\S+$` — admit any non-space string, so the boundary validator
//! cannot express the requirement.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over: the scheme (the required one, the
//! plaintext sibling, another transport, none at all), the spelling's case (a URL's scheme
//! is case-insensitive, RFC 3986 §3.1), the host form (a registered name and an IP
//! literal), what follows the host (nothing, a path, a port, a query) and the forms that
//! name no host (a bare host, a relative path, a scheme-relative reference, a single-slash
//! authority, a string that is no URL). Every row is driven through BOTH writes, each
//! accepted row read back through `GetProcurementPortalPreference` and each refused row
//! checked to have written nothing.
//!
//! The SCOPE is the documentation, not the name: `TestEnvPreferenceInput`'s own
//! `ProcurementPortalInstanceEndpoint` is "the endpoint URL where e-invoices will be
//! delivered in the test environment" (`smithy_query(query="shape",
//! shape="TestEnvPreferenceInput")`), stating no scheme requirement, so a write that
//! configures the test environment on any other scheme is served — pinned by the last test
//! here.
