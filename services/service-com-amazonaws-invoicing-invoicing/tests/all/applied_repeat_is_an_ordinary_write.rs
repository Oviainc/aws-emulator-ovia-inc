//! What a write an `@idempotent` UPDATE applies to a request whose `ClientToken` was
//! already recorded for a DIFFERENT request leaves behind, driven end to end over this
//! service's wire protocol (`POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an
//! awsJson1_0 body) through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses, with
//! the shared harness of `refused_procurement_portal_writes`.
//!
//! The rule under test: a `ClientToken` records the result of ONE request, so a later
//! request stating any other configuration is served on its own merits — and the write it
//! earns is an ORDINARY write of the resource. It is reported by every reader of that
//! resource, it advances the write markers the resource carries (`LastModified` for an
//! invoice unit, `Version` and `LastUpdateDate` for a procurement portal preference), it
//! leaves the parts of the configuration it does not state where the earlier write left
//! them, and it is versioned, so a point-in-time read of an instant between the two calls
//! still reports the earlier request's configuration. Nothing about it differs from the
//! same request sent under no token at all — which is the control each table carries.
//!
//! Each test is a table whose rows differ along WHICH members the later request states —
//! the thing the rule generalises over — and along whether that request carries the spent
//! token or none.
