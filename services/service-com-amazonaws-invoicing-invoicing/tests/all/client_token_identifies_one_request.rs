//! WHICH later request a `ClientToken` replay answers, driven end to end over this
//! service's wire protocol (`POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an
//! awsJson1_0 body) through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses, with
//! the shared harness of `refused_procurement_portal_writes`.
//!
//! The rule under test: a `ClientToken` identifies a REPEAT OF ONE REQUEST, so the result
//! an `@idempotent` operation recorded under a token answers only a later request carrying
//! the same members the recorded one carried. A repeat of the token with any other member
//! value is a DIFFERENT request, which the handler runs on its own merits — applying what
//! that request states, and refusing it where that request earns a refusal. No recorded
//! result stands in for the checks a request is owed.
//!
//! Each test is a table whose rows differ along WHICH member of the repeat differs — the
//! thing the rule generalises over — including the row where none does, which is the
//! replay the token still owes.
