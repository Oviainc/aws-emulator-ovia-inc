//! The ISSUING half of the procurement-portal validation flow:
//! `SendProcurementPortalValidation` "initiates the validation process by issuing a
//! validation code that confirms ownership and connectivity of the configured procurement
//! portal endpoint" (`smithy_query(query="doc",
//! shape="SendProcurementPortalValidation")`), so issuing that code is the work the call
//! performs, and `VerifyProcurementPortalValidation` completes the flow on the code the
//! send issued.
//!
//! Every call goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses, with
//! the shared harness of `refused_procurement_portal_writes` rather than a copy of it. The
//! one thing read out of state is the issued CODE: the modelled response carries only the
//! ARN, because the real service delivers the code through the portal the preference
//! configures.
//!
//! The rules under test, each spanned by a table rather than one request:
//!
//! * a send against a preference that exists issues a code, in the six-decimal-digit form
//!   the flow's `Code` is quoted in, which the verify then accepts — over the portals the
//!   enum admits, at several configuration-version counts, and however many sends preceded
//!   it (a later send retires the code an earlier one issued);
//! * every send issues a code of its own whatever `ClientToken` it carries: a refused call
//!   records no answer for a later one to replay, and this emulator's send reports the
//!   delivery of the test e-invoice it could not make;
//! * a completed validation can be started again: the next send issues a code of its own
//!   and the consumed one completes nothing;
//! * issuing a code writes no CONFIGURATION, so no configuration member a reader reports
//!   moves — what the write does advance is the `Version` and `LastUpdateDate` every
//!   applied write of the resource advances — and neither does completing the validation,
//!   whose only reported effect besides those two is the verification status of the planes
//!   it validated (the rule `completed_validation_moves_the_plane_status` spans).
