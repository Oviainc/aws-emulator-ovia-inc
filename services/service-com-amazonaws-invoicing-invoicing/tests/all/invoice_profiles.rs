//! `BatchGetInvoiceProfile`, driven end to end over this service's wire protocol.
//!
//! Every call here goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router
//! uses: `POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an awsJson1_0
//! body. Nothing reaches into the state struct, so what these tests see is exactly
//! what an SDK client sees.
//!
//! The operation is documented "This gets the invoice profile associated with a set of
//! accounts. The accounts must be linked accounts under the requester management account
//! organization" (`smithy_query(query="doc", shape="BatchGetInvoiceProfile")`), so the
//! rule under test is: a profile is reported for an account the requester may be answered
//! for — one this service's state names as a LINKED account of the requester's
//! organization, and the requester's OWN account, which it may read because it
//! authenticates as it — and any other account id refuses the request whole with the
//! modelled 403. The tables below span every way an account enters (and leaves) that
//! organization in this service's state, the request shapes a batch takes (one account,
//! several, duplicated, many, reordered) and the read-only contract.
