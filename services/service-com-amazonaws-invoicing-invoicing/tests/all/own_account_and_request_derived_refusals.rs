//! The three rules this suite pins, each over a table spanning its class rather than one
//! recorded request. Every call goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production
//! router uses (`POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an awsJson1_0
//! body), so what these tests see is exactly what an SDK client sees.
//!
//! 1. `BatchGetInvoiceProfile` answers a profile for every account the requester may be
//!    answered for — every account this service's state names as a LINKED account of the
//!    requester's organization, and the requester's OWN account, which it may read because
//!    it authenticates as it — and reserves the modelled 403 `AccessDeniedException` for
//!    any other well-formed account id, refusing such a request WHOLE.
//! 2. A `ResourceNotFoundException` of the PROCUREMENT-PORTAL-PREFERENCE plane states a
//!    message BUILT FROM THE REQUEST: the kind of resource asked about and the exact ARN
//!    supplied for it, whichever operation of that plane answers. The invoice-unit and
//!    tag planes keep the sentence the shape documents, which is what their own recorded
//!    bodies carry.
//! 3. The duplicate-`Name` refusal of `CreateInvoiceUnit` states the service's TEMPLATE
//!    over the requested name — the name enclosed in angle brackets — so the offending
//!    name is recoverable from the message by those delimiters whatever characters it
//!    contains.
