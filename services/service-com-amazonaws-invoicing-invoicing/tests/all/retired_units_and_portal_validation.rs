//! What a DELETE leaves behind for a point-in-time read, the per-resource tag quota,
//! the procurement-portal validation flow, the `ProcurementPortalName` value set and
//! the duplicate-`Name` refusal — driven end to end over this service's wire protocol.
//!
//! Every call here goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router
//! uses: `POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an awsJson1_0
//! body, so what these tests see is what an SDK client sees. The one exception is the
//! portal-validation code, which the real service delivers OUT OF BAND through the portal
//! the preference configures and the modelled responses never carry: the tests below have
//! `SendProcurementPortalValidation` issue it and then read it out of this service's
//! state, because there is no wire to carry it.
//!
//! The tables span the class each rule generalises over rather than one recorded
//! request: a unit's whole lifetime at several version counts, tagged and untagged; the
//! tag quota approached in several batch sizes; the portal-validation refusals over
//! several well-formed ARNs and codes; every value of the portal-name enum; and the
//! duplicate-name refusal over several name shapes.
