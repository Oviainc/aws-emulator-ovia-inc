//! What a REFUSED call of the procurement-portal-preference plane leaves behind, driven
//! end to end over this service's wire protocol (`POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Invoicing.<OperationName>` and an awsJson1_0 body, through the same
//! `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses).
//!
//! The rule under test: `ProcurementPortalPreference$Version` is "the version number of
//! the procurement portal preference configuration" and `LastUpdateDate` is "the date and
//! time when the procurement portal preference was last updated"
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="ProcurementPortalPreference")`), so a call the
//! service refuses BEFORE it writes anything leaves BOTH exactly as the last write left
//! them — however many times it is repeated. The version a reader sees is therefore one
//! plus the number of calls that wrote the resource, and a refusal that wrote nothing never
//! shifts it.
//!
//! Each test is a table rather than one request: the rows span the refusal classes this
//! plane answers (the configuration update, the status update — its empty request, its
//! unmodelled status and the transitions a caller may not ask for — and a conflicting
//! create: 400 and 409 alike), the portals a preference can route to, the ORDER refusals
//! and successful calls arrive in, and — for the validation flow, whose refusal keeps a
//! failed-attempt count of its own — whether a validation code is OUTSTANDING when the
//! submitted one is refused. A code is made outstanding through the call that issues one,
//! `SendProcurementPortalValidation`, and then read from state, because the modelled
//! response carries only the ARN.
