//! WHOSE login a token this service minted is.
//!
//! RULE: a token this service mints is minted FOR one identity — "If the token is for
//! cognito-identity.amazonaws.com, it will be passed through to Security Token Service with
//! the appropriate role for the token" (`GetCredentialsForIdentity`, this service's model),
//! and the issuance records which identity that is — so presenting it under this service's
//! own provider name is a login of THAT identity and of no other: a request naming any other
//! identity is refused with the modelled `NotAuthorizedException` (HTTP 400) and vends
//! nothing, and an identity belonging to the pool that minted it, that is also what keeps a
//! token minted in one identity pool out of every other pool's identities. The refusal is
//! answered before any role is resolved and before any session is minted, and it costs the
//! token nothing: presented for the identity it WAS minted for, the same token is still
//! exchanged.
//!
//! WHICH refusal it is, is decided by the pool the token is read against — the pool that owns
//! the identity the request names. A token of THAT pool, minted for another of its
//! identities, is one of the pool's tokens and simply not a login of the identity named, so
//! the refusal is the login mismatch; a token ANOTHER pool minted is no Cognito token of this
//! pool at all, and the refusal says that instead.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which identity the presented token
//! names against which the request names (the same one, another of the same pool, one of
//! another pool, in both directions), how the token was minted
//! (`GetOpenIdToken` for an unauthenticated identity, `GetOpenIdToken` for a federated one,
//! `GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity` for a backend-authenticated one), and whether the
//! `Logins` map presents the token alone or beside a login of another provider.
//!
//! The harness is `identity_pool_flow`'s: one shared engine behind the same
//! `MultiServiceRouter` the production router builds, with the role each vend assumes seeded
//! into the IAM store of that same engine.
