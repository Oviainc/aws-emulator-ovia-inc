//! What authenticated the identity a REDEEMED token names, as the trust policy deciding the
//! assume sees it.
//!
//! RULE: the authentication methods a web-identity assume publishes to a role's trust policy
//! — the `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:amr` condition key — are the ones recorded when the
//! token being redeemed was ISSUED, the providers that authenticated the identity, not the
//! provider name the token is handed back under. So a role whose trust policy admits only
//! one of those providers admits exactly the logins authenticated by it: a
//! developer-authenticated login is told apart from a user-pool login even though both are
//! presented under this service's own provider name, in the enhanced flow
//! (`GetCredentialsForIdentity`) and at `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, where a client
//! redeems the same token itself.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which provider authenticated the
//! identity (the pool's developer provider, its user pool, a public provider, none at all)
//! and which provider the deciding role's `amr` clause names — including `authenticated`
//! itself, which every authenticated exchange names. The harness is
//! `vended_role_session`'s: this service and STS on ONE shared engine behind the same
//! `MultiServiceRouter` the production router builds, with the IAM roles the decision reads
//! seeded into that same engine.
