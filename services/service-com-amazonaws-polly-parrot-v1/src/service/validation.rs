//! The accepted value set this service STATES when it refuses a value outside an
//! enumerated member.
//!
//! RULE: a request-shape refusal states an enumerated member's accepted values as the
//! SERVICE publishes that enum's set — its own membership, in its own fixed order —
//! which is a property of the service and not of the order the model happens to
//! declare that enum's members in. The set is a per-service constant: nothing in the
//! request and nothing in the store varies it, and an enum is recognised by its value
//! SET rather than by the member that carried the rejected value, so every member
//! targeting one enum — of any operation, at any depth, body-bound, query-bound or
//! header-bound — states that enum's set alike.
//!
//! Only the DATA is this crate's: [`STATED_LANGUAGE_CODE_VALUES`] and the table it sits
//! in. The restatement itself, the clause and the envelope all come from the shared home
//! for boundary-refusal wording ([`service_common::validation_message`]) and from the
//! framework underneath it, so this service cannot word a constraint differently from
//! any other.
//!
//! Which values the service ACCEPTS is a different question, and stays with the model:
//! the enum a member targets is what admits or refuses a value. A set this service
//! publishes a statement of may therefore list fewer values than the model declares —
//! that is what Amazon Polly's own refusal does — and listing a value is not what makes
//! it acceptable.
//!
//! Two paths reach this module, so a header-bound member and a body member state one
//! enum's set identically — both from the VIOLATIONS the framework reports, never from a
//! sentence already written:
//!
//! * [`stated_refusal`], from [`crate::service::EmulatedService::override_refusal`] —
//!   every operation whose request the framework's own boundary walks; and
//! * [`stated_envelope`], from the one hand-authored operation, which reads its own
//!   request through the shared reader
//!   ([`service_common::event_stream::read_request`]) and is handed the same violations.
