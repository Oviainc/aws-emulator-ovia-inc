//! Every REFUSAL of this API names the request it refuses, over the whole surface rather
//! than over one plane.
//!
//! SES v1 speaks `awsQuery` (`smithy_query(query="service_info")`: protocols
//! `["awsQuery"]`), and an `awsQuery` refusal is the WHOLE envelope — the `<Error>`
//! sub-tree AND the `<RequestId>` sibling that names the refused request:
//!
//! ```xml
//! <ErrorResponse>
//!   <Error><Type>Sender</Type><Code>…</Code><Message>…</Message></Error>
//!   <RequestId>…</RequestId>
//! </ErrorResponse>
//! ```
//!
//! No model declares that element, so the framework's error renderers write `<Error>`
//! alone while a SUCCESS has carried its own id in `<ResponseMetadata>` all along: a
//! refusal was strictly less diagnosable than a success, and an SDK surfaced no request id
//! for a failed call at all.
//!
//! `ses_query_error_envelope.rs` pins that rule across the LAYERS that can render a
//! refusal (a handler's modelled error, this service's synthetic channel, a framework
//! refusal, a routing failure). This suite pins it across the RESOURCE PLANES and the
//! REASONS one operation refuses for, which is the other axis the rule generalises over:
//! each row below is a different operation refusing a different request for a different
//! documented reason, and every one of them has to name its request.
//!
//! The rows span:
//!
//! * the configuration-set plane — a name the account already holds, a name it does not
//!   hold on three different operations, and a sub-resource (tracking options) the set does
//!   not carry;
//! * the receipt-rule plane — an absent rule set, an absent rule inside a live rule set,
//!   and a rule set that may not be deleted because it is the ACTIVE one;
//! * the custom-verification-template plane — a sender address this account has not
//!   verified;
//! * the identity-policy plane — a document that is no policy, in three different shapes;
//! * and a value outside a modelled enum (`DeliveryOptions$TlsPolicy`), which the
//!   framework refuses before the handler runs.
//!
//! Each plane is also asked for a name of a different CLASS — digits, non-ASCII text, and
//! text carrying the envelope's own markup — so the envelope cannot depend on the shape of
//! what the request named.
//!
//! The successes the setup needs are rows in the negative: a success is no error envelope,
//! and its one id stays in `<ResponseMetadata>`.
