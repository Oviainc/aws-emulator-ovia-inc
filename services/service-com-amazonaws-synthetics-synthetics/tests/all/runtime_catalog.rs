//!
//! The rule pinned here: `DescribeRuntimeVersions` reports the service's ONE published
//! catalog of canary runtime versions, newest first, where each entry carries the version's
//! name, the language canaries on it are written in, a description listing what that version
//! bundles, its release date and a deprecation date only once that version is deprecated —
//! and every version the catalog reports is a version a canary can be created on, while a
//! version it does not report is refused.
//!
//! The rows below therefore span what the rule generalises over rather than one recorded
//! call: every runtime family the service publishes (Node.js with Playwright, Node.js with
//! Puppeteer, Python with Selenium and the retired families it still names), both languages,
//! `.0` releases and patch releases, the newest and the oldest entry, and names the catalog
//! does not publish.
