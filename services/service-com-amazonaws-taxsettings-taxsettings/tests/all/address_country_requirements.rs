//! The per-country requirements the model states on the MEMBERS of a
//! `TaxRegistrationEntry`, over the wire.
//!
//! TWO rules, each asserted over a table that spans what it generalises over,
//! through BOTH writers of an entry (`PutTaxRegistration` and
//! `BatchPutTaxRegistration`), because the rule set is shared:
//!
//! 1. A submitted legal address held in a jurisdiction whose registration the
//!    model documents `stateOrRegion` as required for must name one: an entry
//!    that omits it is refused with `ValidationException` (HTTP 400,
//!    `MissingInput`) naming that parameter and nothing is stored, while an
//!    address held anywhere else, or one the service fills in itself, is stored
//!    without it. The rows differ along the jurisdiction (each country of the
//!    documented set, two countries outside it), the registration type the
//!    Brazilian requirement turns on, the case the country code is spelled in,
//!    and whether the address was submitted at all.
//! 2. A Canadian entry that claims a provincial sales tax ID for a TRN held in
//!    one of the provinces where that claim is a reseller claim must confirm
//!    that purchases are for resale: an entry that does not is refused with
//!    `ValidationException` (HTTP 400, `FieldValidationFailed`) naming that
//!    parameter. The rows differ along the province (each of the three, by name
//!    and by subdivision code, and two provinces outside the set), whether the
//!    ID is claimed, and the value of the confirmation.
//!
//! The source of both rule statements is the model:
//! `smithy_query(query="doc",shape="com.amazonaws.taxsettings#Address",member="stateOrRegion")`
//! and
//! `smithy_query(query="shape",shape="com.amazonaws.taxsettings#CanadaAdditionalInfo")`.
//!
//! The harness (`emulator`, `call`) lives in `tax_registration_lifecycle.rs` and
//! the two writers in `country_rules.rs`; nothing here builds a second one.
