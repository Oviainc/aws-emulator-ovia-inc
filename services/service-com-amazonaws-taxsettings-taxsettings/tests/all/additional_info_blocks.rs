//! The `additionalTaxInformation` object's own rule, over the restJson1 wire.
//!
//! ONE rule: an `additionalTaxInformation` object a write submits must carry
//! exactly ONE country block, and that block must be the one belonging to the
//! jurisdiction the entry identifies; an object with no block, with more than
//! one, or with a block of another jurisdiction is refused with
//! `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) carrying `FieldValidationFailed` and nothing
//! is persisted.
//!
//! The source of the rule is the shape's own documentation
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape",shape="com.amazonaws.taxsettings#AdditionalInfoRequest")`):
//! "You can only specify one of the following parameters and the value can't be
//! empty", and "The parameter that you specify must match the country for the
//! TRN".
//!
//! The tables span the class the rule generalises over rather than the one
//! reported request (a Polish entry carrying both `polandAdditionalInfo` and
//! `canadaAdditionalInfo`, which is one row of `count_cases`): EVERY country
//! block the model declares is driven through the jurisdiction rule, the block
//! count is driven at 0, 2 and 3 blocks, and the accepted side — one block
//! matching the jurisdiction — is driven for blocks the issue never cited and for
//! a lower-case `countryCode`.
//!
//! The harness (`emulator`, `call`, `field_list`) lives in
//! `tax_registration_lifecycle.rs`; nothing here builds a second one.
