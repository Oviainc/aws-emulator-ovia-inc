//! Safety rules, end to end over HTTP: created in a control panel, read back, listed,
//! updated and deleted.
//!
//! Every assertion goes through the router the production emulator mounts, so these
//! exercise routing, restJson1 (de)serialization, the handlers and the shared engine
//! together.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a table that spans what it generalises over
//! rather than the one request that exposed it:
//!
//! * a created safety rule is PERSISTED: every member of the created rule is the one the
//!   request asked for, and a later read projects the same record. The table spans both
//!   kinds of rule, every `RuleType` the model declares, both values of `Inverted`,
//!   several thresholds, control lists of one to three entries and several wait periods;
//! * a safety rule's controls are the routing controls of the ONE control panel it is
//!   scoped to, so a control of another panel is refused like one that is not stored;
//! * a control panel's rules are listed together in creation order, each under the `Rule`
//!   member its own kind fills, and paged by `MaxResults`/`NextToken`;
//! * the rule configuration is stored as the request sends it: the control plane does not
//!   couple the threshold to how many controls the rule names, so a threshold below, at
//!   and above that number is served and read back unchanged;
//! * an update changes the name and the wait period of the rule it addresses and nothing
//!   else, and is refused for the other kind of rule, for an ARN holding no rule, and for
//!   a name another rule of the same control panel already holds;
//! * a deleted rule is gone, and neither the control panel that scopes a rule nor a
//!   routing control the rule references is deletable while the rule is there.
